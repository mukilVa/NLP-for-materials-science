The variation of the lattice constant with alloying elements is an essential issue in alloy design. In the traditional
single-based alloys, there is a tremendous database for predicting the lattice constant. However, the traditional
database is not suitable to the emerging multi-principal components alloys referred as high entropy alloys.
Here, a framework is proposed to describe the variation of lattice constants in high entropy alloys. Based on
the quantitative measurement of the lattice constants of fourteen alloys, we constructed the lattice constant da-
tabase for concentrated CoCrFeNi alloys. The discrepancy between binary alloys and high entropy alloys revealed
the atomic chemical interactions.

As one of the most important physical parameters in crystalline ma-
terials, the lattice constant has been involved everywhere in the mate-
rial science and engineering [1]. Simply, the thermal expansion can be
exactly revealed from the temperature-dependent lattice constants
[2]. Another case is the lattice distortion, playing a crucial role in mate-
rial science [3]. Even in superconductivity, the lattice distortion is
thought to be one of the most important factors in determining the tran-
sition temperature [4]. Furthermore, the lattice misfit of phase bound-
aries determines both the functional and mechanical behaviors of
multiphase materials [5,6]. Therefore, the regulation of the lattice con-
stant is very important in the material science and engineering.

It is a foundation work to understand and determine the variation of
lattice constants from different aspects [1]. The investigations presented
all main factors of size, valance, and electrochemical differences, as well
as the relative sizes of ions and atoms in determining the lattice spacing
of binary solutions. The Vegard's law is commonly used to describe the
atomic size effect; while its invalidation has been confirmed with the
main effect of valence-electron difference [7,8]. Extensive experiments
have been done to determine the variation of lattice spacing in binary
and some dilute ternary alloy systems.

Recently, the initiation of high entropy alloys (HEAs) stimulates nu-
merous studies on the multi-principal component alloys [9]. The varia-
tion of the lattice constant in HEAs is very important in alloy design,

revealing the unique functional and mechanical behaviors. However, it
is improper to simply extend the variation of lattice constants in binary
alloys to HEAs. In HEAs, there is no single-element base, where the in-
teractions of different elements in the lattice will make the variation
of the lattice constants much more complicated. Up to now, there are
only limited high resolution data of HEAs [10]. Most of XRD data in
the numerical literatures needs careful calibrations for high precision.
On the one hand, the different processes of rolling, quenching, solid so-
lution treatments may cause significant errors. On the other hand, the
low-accuracy XRD data cannot quantitatively reveal the lattice constant.
A self-consistent high precision measurement is desired to reveal the
variation of lattice constants. Usually, (311) peaks in FCC from an ex-
treme low scanning rate could ensure the reproducibility of
0.00001 nm on lattice constant [1].

Besides the high precision measurement, the model for variation of
lattice constant also needs to be evaluated. Traditionally, the lattice
spacing of binary alloys can be described by

da
Gd=M +6, (1)

where dp is the lattice spacing of the pure metal of a solvent, c is the con-
centration of solute. In Vegard's law, da/dc = a; — do, where a, is the lat-
tice spacing of the pure solute. Usually, da/dc is a constant in a finite
range of small c even with the valence effect. As the development of me-
tallic materials, the problem how to describe the lattice spacing in mul-
ticomponent system has emerged. For simplicity, it can be described in

dilute alloys with different elements as
n—1
da
a=d+) —~G, (2)

where ¢; is the concentration of ith solute, da/dc; is the lattice change co-
efficient for the corresponding solute. In a dilute solution, da/dc; is sim-
ilar to that in the binary alloys. However, in the concentrated alloys of
HEAs, the interactions between the solutes will make the da/dc; deviates
from that in the binary alloys. In HEAs, a new model is required to de-
scribe the variation of the lattice constants with alloying compositions.
A phenomenological model has also been proposed to describe the lat-
tice spacing variation in alloys [11],

s=S°S > ccjsj, (3)

i=l j=l

where c; and c; are the atomic fractions of the components of i and j, sj; is
the spacing between the two adjacent atoms of components of i and j. It
is obvious that the model has more coefficients than Eq. (2), so06 they
can describe the experimental curves within a wide range of composi-
tions. In binary alloys, Eq. (3) has two unknown parameters of s;2 and
S21. In multicomponent alloys with n elements, there will be n(n — 1)
parameters in Eq. (3). Even though, this model still does not consider
the interaction between the different solutes; for instance, 5; is inde-
pendent of other species.

In order to describe the atomic interactions in HEAs, one choice is to
add more terms in Eq. (2), such as

n—1 n—1n—1
a=dj+ So aic, a SS) Otic, (4)
i=l i=l jai

where aij is used to describe the interaction of elements of i and j. This
method is basically an extension of the single-based alloys, and still
has too many parameters for multicomponent alloys. In HEAs, the
basic concept is a solid solution of multicomponent elements, nor a sin-
gle element again. Accordingly, we propose a choosing of multicompo-
nent for reference and it can reveal the interactions between the
different alloying elements. Based on this, the lattice parameter of
HEAs can be described as

n—-1 d
a= a +S aay cio) (3)

where dp is the lattice parameter of the reference HEA, (c; — Cg) is the
derivation from the initial composition. Sicne the HEAs are located in
the central region of their phase diagram, the differential da/d(c; — co)
can be assumed as a constant in a finite range. The physical meaning
of the model is how the lattice spacing changes as the one of the ith el-
ement substitute nth elements. Although Eqs. (2) and (5) have the sim-
ilar form, the different references generate the different physical
meanings. Moreover, the interactions between different elements
could be revealed in Eq. (5) due to that the other elements will affect
the variation of lattice spacing during the change of each element. Ac-
cordingly, in the local range of concentrated alloy composition, the da/
d(c; — Co) will be different from that in binary alloys. Additional advan-
tage of Eq. (5) is the fewer unknown coefficients (n — 1) compared with
Eqs. (3) and (4).

In order to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed model,
quantitative experiments are designed to find the useful coefficients for
future applications. The equiatomic CoCrFeNi alloy is one of the most
popular systems among HEAs. Fourteen alloys with different variations
of each element are designed to investigate the change of lattice spacing
in CoCrFeNi system. The alloys preparation and the detected composi-
tions are listed in Ref. [12]. The as-cast samples were cold-rolled to

60% and recrystallized at 1200 °C for 5 min, and then water quenched
to room temperature for lattice parameter measurements. The crystal
structures were identified by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Shimadzu,
MAXima XRD-7000), using Cu Ka radiation with a scanning rate of 5°/
min.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD results. All the alloys are confirmed as FCC sin-
gle solid solutions. The obvious shift of (311) peaks reveals the variation
of lattice spacing in different alloys. The lattice parameters of the alloys
can be accurately determined by using (311) peaks. For a higher

precision measurement, we further scan the sample from 90° to 92.5°
with a scan rate of 0.09°/min. The increasing step of the angle is
0.001° while the precision of the protractor on the X-ray diffractometer
is 0.0001°. In the determination of the (311) peaks, the fitting of the
peak shows that the error of 20 is 620 < 0.0005, as shown in Fig. 1(c).
Combining the errors from the fitting and the increasing step of the
angle in the measurement, the error 60 is smaller than 0.001. The lattice
constant is calculated by

AVTI 1
a= 2 ~~ sing’ (6)

where A is 0.104056 nm for the X-radiation wavelengths of Cu Kay, 6 is
around 45.56° for the Bragg angle of (311) peaks. Then the error estima-
tion of the lattice constant for (311) peaks is

da = a — 80—ad + 60<0.00002nm, (7)

which is consistent with the high precision lattice spacing measurement
[1]. The calculated lattice constants are shown in Fig. 2 (listed in
Table 1). The high precision measurement can distinguish the variation
of lattice constants caused by a small change of the alloying composi-
tion. The error of the lattice constant from the measurement is very
small.

In the quaternary alloys, Eq. (5) gives

d = dg + Aco (Cco—Cco0) + cr (Cor —Ccro) + Ore (Cre —Creo); (8)

where a; = da/d(c; — Co). By choosing the equiatomic alloy as the refer-
ence, the data in Table 1 give the coefficients in Eq. (8) by regression
analysis with the linear least square method, where the real alloy com-
positions detected from EDS in SEM are used. The results show ac = —
0.18304 x 10-4 nm/at.%, ac, = 1.06905 x 107-4 nm/at.%, Oe = 0.54192
x 10-4 nm/at.% with the correlation coefficient of 0.9411. The lattice pa-
rameters predicted by Eq. (8) from regression coefficients are also
shown in Fig. 2. The predictions are strongly correlated with the exper-
imental measurements. The maximum difference is only 0.0003 nm.
The ab-initial method is further used to calculate the variation of lat-
tice constants with the change of alloying compositions. The first-
principles calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simu-
lation (VASP) Package. Projector augmented wave (PAW) potential [13]
was used to describe the electron-ion interactions, and the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) [14] was applied to describe the elec-
tronic exchange and correlation. For each composition, the supercells
with 3 x 3 x 5 fcc unit cells were applied, all of the atoms are randomly
distributed across the lattice sites. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave

basis set was set to be 500 eV, and the reciprocal space was sampled by
using the Monkhorst-Pack grids [15]. All calculations were performed
with spin-polarization. Equilibrium cell volumes and all internal atomic
positions of the supercells were fully relaxed until convergence with the
total energy tolerance of 10~° eV. The ab initio calculated results are
shown in Fig. 3. The calculated lattice parameter is fixed at 0 K, and
smaller than the measured data at ambient temperature. However,
the change of lattice constant with compositions has the same trend.
We further use Eq. (8) to predict the variation of lattice constants with
regression coefficients from experiment data. The predictions are very
close to the ab initial calculation results. It should be noted that the co-
efficients in Eq. (8) may be varied with temperatures due to the differ-
ent thermal expansion coefficients. Here we just use the coefficients at
ambient temperature to predict the variation of lattice constants at
0 K for comparison with the ab initial calculation results.

The variation of lattice constants in the experiments and ab initial
calculations indicates that the Co has a minor effect on the lattice spac-
ing in the concentrated CoCrFeNi alloys by substituting Ni. The Cr and Fe
will significantly increase the lattice spacing by substituting Ni and the
Cr is the best one to increase the lattice parameter. Previously, the lattice
distortion in HEAs is only discussed by considering the atomic size ef-
fects [16,17]. Apparently, the Co has the largest radius in the four ele-
ments based on previous reported data [18]. However, the Co has the
smallest impact on the lattice constant of the concentrated alloys, and
even decreases the lattice constant. The derivation from the hard sphere

packing may come from the chemical interaction of different elements
[7].

In HEAs, with interactions between different elements, the variation
of lattice constants in HEAs will be different from that in binary alloys.
Fig. 4 shows the difference of the coefficients from binary alloys and
HEAs. In the Ni-Co, Ni-Cr and Ni-Fe binary alloys, the da/dc are 0.17
x 10~4, 1.07 x 10~4 and 1.29 x 10~* nm/at.%, respectively [1,6,10]. In
HEAS, Qico = —0.18304 x 104, Ac, = 1.06905 x 10~4, Ore = 0.54192
x 10~* nm/at.%. These differences are from element interactions in
the concentrated alloys. The lattice parameter of CoCrFeNi is larger
than that of pure Ni, but smaller than the calculation from the binary ef-
fect of Eq. (2). It means that there are extra interactions between these
four elements in the concentrated alloys, as compared with the Ni-
based binary alloys. By adding Cr as substitution of Ni in the HEAs,
some of the Ni—Co, Ni—Fe bonds are substituted by Cr—Co, Cr—Fe
bonds. In binary alloys, the increase of Cr—Ni bond contributes to the
lattice dilation while in HEAs there are contributions from Cr—Co,
Cr—Fe bonds. Therefore, the similar Cr effect in the CoCrFeNi and Ni-
based binary alloys indicates that

(CresFe) = (CresCo) & (CreNi) (9)

A <«B means the atomic bond of A and B elements. As for the Fe and
Co elements, the mainly difference in HEAs and Ni-based binary alloys is
from

(FeoCr)>(FeeNi), (CooCr)>(CoeNi) (10)

Therefore, the increases of Co and Fe in the CoCrFeNi will cause a
smaller effect on the expansion of lattice constants than that of Co and
Fe in Ni-based binary alloys. The effects of Co—Co, Fe—Fe and Cr—Cr
bonds in HEAs on the lattice constant are hidden in the coefficient of
da/d(c — co), and reveal that the atomic bonds of (Cr « Fe), (Cr = Co)
and (Cr « Ni) are stronger than those of (Co « Ni) and (Fe « Ni).
These results indicate that the Cr related short chemical range order
may exist in the CoCrFeNi alloys at lower temperature. The Cr related
short chemical range order has been predicted in CoCrNi by simulations
[19].

Moreover, the quantitative information of lattice parameter is a very
important factor in alloy design. Firstly, the variation of lattice parame-
ters in solid solutions corresponds to the solid solution hardening deter-
mined by the lattice distortion. The results presented here show the Cr
has the strongest lattice distortion effect, consistent with previous ex-
periment results [20]. Secondly, the precipitation hardening HEAs are
prosperous very recently, where the lattice misfit is a very important
factor in strengthening and coarsening [21]. It is one of the core issues
to adjust the lattice misfit in the design of advanced high performance

precipitation-hardening HEAs [22]. The prediction of lattice parameters
in the solid solution matrix obtained here is helpful in designing high
performance HEAs.

In conclusion, we proposed a model to describe the variation of lat-
tice constants with constitution of alloying elements in HEAs. Quantita-
tive measurement of the lattice constant in fourteen CoCrFeNi based
alloys confirms the model of lattice variation. The change of lattice con-
stants in the CoCrFeNi alloys deviates from the hard sphere packing
model and the lattice change in binary alloys. The comparison shows a
chemical effect on the lattice distortion and indicates the existence of
a strong Cr-related short range chemical order. The model and the
quantitative data of lattice spacing presented here is useful in the alloy
design of HEAs.
