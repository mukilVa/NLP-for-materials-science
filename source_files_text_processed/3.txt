Tailorable magnetic state near room temperature is very promising for several technological, including mag-
netocaloric applications. Here using first-principle alloy theory, we determine the Curie temperature (Tc) of a
number of equiatomic medium- and high-entropy alloys with solid solution phases. All calculations are per-
formed at the computed lattice parameters, which are in line with the available experimental data. Theory
predicts a large crystal structure dependence of Tc, which explains the experimental observations under specified

conditions. The sensitivity of the magnetic state to the crystal lattice is reflected by the magnetic exchange
interactions entering the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The analysis of the effect of composition on Tc allows re-
searchers to explore chemistry-dependent trends and design new multi-component alloys with pre-assigned

magnetic properties.

 

1. Introduction

Based on a distinct concept of alloy design, Yeh et al. introduced a
new class of materials, the high-entropy alloys (HEAs) [1], which has
attracted extensive attention from the academic and metallurgic re-
search communities over the recent years [2-6]. Unlike conventional
alloys, HEAs are characterized by their special compositions containing
multiple elements in equal or near-equal molar ratios. Several im-
portant features in these alloys have been postulated, including high
entropy, sluggish diffusion, and severe lattice distortion [7]. It is of
particular interest to notice that many reported HEAs possess simple
[e.g., face-centered cubic (fcc) and/or body-centered cubic (bcc)
structures] yet chemically disordered solid solution phases [8]. In ad-
dition, these alloys display a variety of technologically appealing and
tunable properties, such as excellent specific strength [9], exceptional
ductility and fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures [10], en-
couraging fatigue resistance [11], and superconductivity [12].

Recently, it was suggested that HEAs could be exciting candidate
materials for magnetic refrigeration applications. The key parameters in
focus are the magnetic entropy change, the adiabatic temperature
change and the refrigerant capacity [13]. Belyea et al. found that Ni-
FeCoCrPd,, displays a second order magnetic phase transition associated

with a slightly decreasing magnetic entropy change and increasing
critical temperature from ~ 100 K to room temperature, which leads to
nearly 40% enhancement of the refrigerant capacity as x increases from
null to 11.11% [14]. Yuan et al. showed that GdDyErHoTb exhibits the
largest refrigerant capacity reported so far (~627Jkg~’ at the 5T
magnetic field), along with a small magnetic hysteresis loss and ductile
mechanical behavior [15]. In most cases, the refrigeration parameters
can be maximized near the critical temperature and thus for widespread
applications the magnetocaloric material should possess Curie tem-
perature (T;) close to the room temperature.

Previous work indicate that T, of HEAs is sensitive to the base
composition, the additional alloying elements, and the crystal structure
[16,17]. In the widely-studied FeCrCoNiAl, system, for example, Al
addition increases the Tc from 130K for FeCrCoNi to 430K for FeCr-
CoNiAl, [18-20], associated with a structural transition from fcc to bec
with an fec-bcc duplex region [21-23]. On the other hand, the available
experimental critical temperatures often carry an unknown error bar
due to the difficulties associated with synthesizing homogeneous solid
solutions [18,19,21]. Despite the appreciable efforts in experiments,
very little theoretical investigations devoted to this question have been
presented so far. This can be attributed to the complexity of the pro-
blem related to the magnetic and chemical disorder in connection with

calculations were carried out using density functional theory im-
plemented in the framework of the exact muffin-tin orbital (EMTO)
formalism [27,28]. The chemical and magnetic disorders in random
system were treated within the coherent potential approximation (CPA)
[29-31]. The exchange-correlation effects were taken into account
within the generalized gradient approximation in the form of Perdew,
Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) [32]. The one-electron Kohn-Sham equa-
tions were solved within the scalar-relativistic approximation and soft-
core scheme. The paramagnetic state was simulated by the disordered
local moments (DLM) approximation [33]. All calculations were per-
formed for completely disordered solid solution and static lattice.

3. Results and discussion

Table 1 shows the basic properties of the selected equiatomic
medium- and high-entropy alloys, including crystal structure, Wigner-
Seitz radius, and Curie temperature. The majority of the selected alloys
are based on the late 3d transition metals [1,18—21,26,34—-53]. Con-
sidering the fact that many of the present alloys, especially the Al
containing systems, possess a mixture of the fcc and bcc phases, in
Table 1 we give the theoretical results for these two phases to bring to
light the related properties as a function of crystal structure.

In Table 1, we compare the theoretical Wigner-Seitz radius with the
corresponding values converted from the available experimental lattice
parameters. It is found that the two sets of data are in reasonable
agreement with each other, and the relative deviation between theory
and experiment is below ~ 2.5%. At the same time, in Fig. 1 (inset), we
plot the calculated T, with reported values for some systems. As can be
seen, the present theoretical work reproduces the trend shown in other
studies, confirming the predictive power of our MFA-based approach.

To illustrate and explore the alloying trends of the studied proper-
ties, here we take FeCoNiCu (in the fcc phase) as a base alloy, and
consider the equimolar V, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ag, and Pt additions. As shown
in Table 1, the calculated equilibrium Wigner-Seitz radius for FeCoNiCu
in ferromagnetic state is 2.641 bohr, which agrees well with the cor-
responding experimental value of 2.648 bohr [41]. Alloying with Cr
decreases the volume of the FeCoNiCu host, in line with the experi-
mental observation [1,41]. In contrast, a volume increases is predicted
when adding V, Mn, Mo, Ag, and Pt, which should partially be attrib-
uted by the larger atomic radius of the considered elements as com-
pared to that of Cr [54].

The calculated Tc for FeCoNiCu is 796 K, which compares well with
the previous theoretical value of 826 K [26]. A significant decrease in
the Tc is revealed when adding equimolar V, Cr, and Mn to the host

composition. The main reason for this decrease is the appearance of the
antiferromagnetic coupling between V/Cr/Mn moments and the Fe-Co-
Ni matrix, as demonstrated below in the case of CrMnFeCoNi, and some
other systems [17,20,55]. On the other hand, the addition of noble
metals, i.e., Ag and Pt, is found to slightly increase the Tc. of the host
alloy. It is of particular interest that in experiment, equimolar Pd ad-
dition to CrFeCoNi increases the Tc from 130K to 440K [18,19]. Our
data indicates a very similar trend for Pt-doped FeCoNiCu. From this
point of view, alloying with noble metals is expected to be a promising
route for fine Tc tuning.

For system with fcc-bcc duplex phases considered here, Tc is pre-
dicted to be larger in the bcc phase than in the fcc phase. Actually this
trend is consistent with the previous work addressing the crystal
structure dependence of the magnetic behavior for CrFeCoNiAl, HEAs
[17]. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1, the above crystal structure effect is
found for most of the systems considered in this work. Here we would
like to highlight a particularly interesting experimental fact which now
gains theoretical support in the mirror of the present data. It is known
that unusual properties can occur in HEAs when specified manu-
facturing process is employed. The single-phase equiatomic CrMnFe-
CoNi alloy [53], which crystallizes in an fcc lattice, is one of the well-
studied examples. Experimental measurements indicate that the system
is in a paramagnetic state down to a temperature of 93K (i.e., the
magnetic transition temperature should be below 93 K) [56]. However,
during mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering process, in the
fcc solid solution matrix a minority bcc phase formed. Measuring the
magnetic hysteresis curves of these two-phase alloys at room tem-
perature indicated that the as-milled powder possesses the character-
istic feature of soft magnet [57], which is fully supported by the pre-
sently predicted T, for the bcc phase.

To understand the magnetic characteristics of CrMnFeCoNi and the
strong crystal structure dependence, here we investigate the magnetic
exchange interactions between alloy components. Fig. 2 shows the re-
duced parameter Jj = ZpJjm;mj, where i and j are atomic indices, m; is
the magnetic moment, Jy is the strength of the exchange interaction,
and z, is the coordination number of the pth coordination shell. As
indicated from Fig. 2, the dominating ferromagnetic interactions in the
bcc phase are between the nearest-neighbor Fe-Fe, Fe-Co, Co-Co, and
Co-Mn pairs, and the anti-ferromagnetic interactions between the
nearest-neighbor Cr-Cr, Cr-Mn, and Mn-Mn pairs. We mention that Cr is
anti-parallel with Mn (as shown in the inset of Fig. 2), thus the positive
value of exchange parameter between Cr and Mn indicates an anti-
ferromagnetic coupling. In the case of the fcc phase, the magnetic be-
havior is mainly due the anti-ferromagnetic couplings between Fe-Mn
and Mn-Mn at the nearest-neighbor distance. Hence, one would expect
a weaker magnetic ordering tendency and a lower critical temperature
for the fcc alloys compared to those for the bcc phase.

Using the present exchange interaction parameters in the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we performed Monte-Carlo simulations for
both fec and bec lattices [17,58]. Fig. 3 shows the temperature de-
pendent magnetization and magnetic susceptibility. It is found that the
Tc of CrMnFeCoNi is 10 + 10K for the fcc phase and 340 + 10K for
the bcc phase. We recall that the Tc calculated via MFA for this system
in the fec and bcc phases are 27 K and 397K, respectively. The good
agreement between these two approaches gives a strong support for our
Tc maps presented in Table 1 (also Table 2). We emphasize the large
structural factor for the Tc. Besides explaining the experimental ob-
servation, the strong structure dependence of the magnetic order opens
new opportunities for further magnetocaloric applications.

Senkov et al. evaluated thousands of equimolar alloy compositions
for potential high-temperature applications by combining calculated
phase diagrams with simple empirical rules [59]. Based on that work,
we expand our study to some promising candidate compositions, as
listed in Table 2, which are suggested to possess single bec phase at
873 K. Taking AIVCrNbMoW as an example, the Wigner-Seize radius is
2.904 bohr as determined from Vegard's rule using the experimental

Intermetallics 95 (2018) 80-84

volumes of the alloy components [28,60]. This estimated value is close
to the EMTO-CPA result of 2.911 bohr. The detailed comparison of the
two sets of data is presented in Table 2. As can be seen, there is a
general good agreement between these two theoretical predictions.

To provide insight for selecting possible magnetic materials, Tc is
also shown in Table 2. It is immediately clear that many of the selected
system are nonmagnetic, while others, e.g., the Fe containing systems,
show relatively low Tc. This is not surprising as most of them contain a
large amount of nonmagnetic elements such as Al, Ti, Nb, Mo, and W,
which dilutes the ferromagnetic component of Fe. We notice that the
present data can be used as a guide to adjust the alloy compositions to a
target Tc. For example, the predicted T, for VMnFe and VCrMnFe are
395 K and 221K, respectively. From linear combination we get 308 K
for VCro.,;MnFe, which is surprisingly close to 292 K obtained from di-
rect MFA calculation. In addition, high Tc is expected for low Cr con-
centration, which is line with the experimental observation for
Cr,FeCoNi system [18].

4. Conclusions

In summary, we put forward a systematic study of the Curie tem-
perature for a number of equiatomic medium- and high-entropy alloys
using first-principle theory. Solid solution phases with fec and/or bec
underlying lattices are considered. Our results are in line with the
available theoretical and experimental data. The analysis of alloying
addition on the Curie temperature, as well as the application of linear
rule of mixture employing base HEAs, are helpful to identify promising
magnetic compositions. Furthermore, the fact that certain HEAs have
drastically different ordering temperature for the bcc and fcc crystal
structures, offers a way to identify alloys with a very sharp change in
the magnetic properties close to a structural phase transition. Exploring
various means to tune this coupled structural-magnetic transition to the
desired temperature range will open new ways for designing materials
with great potential in magnetic refrigeration applications.
