The aim of this work was to apply mechanical alloying technique for synthesis of high entropy multicom-
ponent equimolar WMoNbZrV alloy and to investigate the phase composition after milling and after heat
treatment, as well as to characterize the observed changes of crystallite size, lattice strain and lattice
parameter of solid solution formed. It was found that nanocrystalline bcc solid solution was characterized
by crystallite size of 10 nm, lattice strain of 0.58% and lattice parameter of 3.1687 A. Heating the sample
up to 700 °C resulted in decrease of lattice strain down to 0.20%, while the crystallite size remained not
changed, testifying good thermal stability of nanocrystalline bcc solid solution obtained.

1. Introduction

According to traditional alloy formation concept, majority of
alloys are composed of one main metallic element. In the structure
of these alloys solid solutions, or amorphous phase can be formed.
Other alloying elements result in modification of microstructure
and properties of the alloys. High entropy alloys (HEA) are a new
class of alloys different from conventional ones based on one or
two elements. HEAs contain at least five principal elements with
concentrations between 5 and 35 at% of each one, usually in equia-
tomic ratio. High configurational entropy of HEAs leads to the for-
mation of simple fcc and/or bcc solid solutions rather than complex
intermetallic phases [1-3]. HEAs are manufactured by various
techniques, like conventional casting, rapid solidification, chemical
and physical vapour deposition or mechanical alloying (MA). The
last technique is especially useful for high melting point alloys dif-
ficult for processing by casting techniques. MA has been widely
recognized as an important non-equilibrium solid state processing
route for the synthesis of variety of alloys showing different phase
compositions and microstructures [4]. Selected high melting point
HEAs are widely studied due to their designation for high-
temperature and fusion-facing applications [5,6].

According to our literature review, the alloy studied in this
work has not been reported before. Similar composition has been
investigated by Senkov et al. [7-8]. For WMoNbVTa alloy prepared
by arc melting typical dendritic microstructure has been observed.

The present study is taken up to synthesise WMoNbZrV high
melting equimolar high entropy alloy using mechanical alloying,
as well as to investigate the phase evolution upon milling and after
heat treatment. An additional purpose of this work was to verify
whether the changes of crystallite size, lattice strain and lattice
parameter of single phase solid solution formed upon mechanical
alloying of multicomponent alloy are similar to the ones reported
for conventional mechanically alloyed binary alloys [4].

2. Experimental details

Commercial pure elemental powders of W, Mo, Nb, Zr and V
(purity at least 99.5%, particle size below 50 ym, Alfa Aesar) were
used as the starting materials. An equimolar high entropy alloy
with composition WMoNDbZrV was synthesized (20 at% of each ele-
ment). The milling processes were performed in a Fritsch P5 plan-
etary ball mill equipped with hardened steel vials and balls of
10 mm diameter. Maximum milling time was 100h and the pro-
cess was performed under protective atmosphere of argon. No pro-
cess control agent was added to the powders. The ball-to-powder
weight ratio was 10:1. In order to confirm the alloy formation dur-
ing milling, small amount of powder was taken out after selected
processing times for structural characterization. The milled sam-
ples were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using Rigaku Mini-
Flex Il diffractometer with Cu Ko radiation (4 = 1.5418 A), for
phase formation monitoring and for calculation of the crystallite
size and lattice strain in milled powders. For this purpose
Williamson-Hall approach was adopted [9]. The lattice parameters
determination of bcc phase was done by applying Nelson-Riley
D. Oleszak et al./ Materials Letters 232 (2018) 160-162

extrapolation method [10]. To evaluate the thermal structural sta-
bility, the product after final milling time (100 h) was continuously
heated in the calorimeter (Perkin Elmer DSC 7, heating rate
40 K min~', argon flow) from room temperature up to 700 °C and
next subjected to XRD measurements. Chemical composition of
the powders has been verified by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy
(XRF) using DELTA analyzer, Olympus.

3. Results and discussion

The sequence of diffraction patterns obtained for the powder
mixture subjected to mechanical alloying for selected times is pre-
sented in Fig. 1. At the initial state the diffraction lines correspond-
ing to all the starting elements are visible. It can be noticed that

diffraction lines and gradual disappearance of some of them can
be seen at the diffraction patterns. The diffraction lines of Zr and
V disappear after 2 and 5h of processing, respectively. Next, Nb
diffraction lines vanish after 20h of milling. This suggests that in
the milled powders synthesis of the alloy takes place.

Milling of the alloy for the time longer than 20 h does not cause
major changes in the diffraction pattern and the final product is a
single-phase solid solution with the bcc lattice structure. However,
further broadening of the diffraction lines related to crystallite size
decrease and/or lattice strain increase is registered. The XRD pat-
tern for the sample subjected to milling and next heated in the
DSC up to 700 °C is also presented in Fig. 1. The presented pattern
is very similar to the one recorded for the sample milled only.

The changes of crystallite size and lattice strain for bcc solid
solution as a function of milling time are plotted in Fig. 2. The crys-
tallite size decreases gradually reaching about 11 nm +2 nm for
the final processing stage. Whereas, lattice strain shows a maxi-
mum of 0.58% + 0.05% for intermediate milling time and decreases
with longer processing. Both curves (D and e vs milling time) exhi-
bit a behavior typical for metallic powders subjected to mechanical
milling [4]. Additionally, the values of crystallite size and lattice
strain of bcc solid solution after heating the sample in the DSC
are also marked in Fig. 2. The powder after 50 h of MA was heated
in a calorimeter in the temperature range from 50 to 700 °C at con-
stant heating rate of 40 K min“! in order to check the thermal sta-
bility of the structure of the obtained alloy. The results of XRD
studies indicate that after heating practically there are no qualita-
tive changes in the pattern and the bcc structure is preserved, tes-
tifying good thermal stability of the synthesized bcc phase.
However, the broadening of registered diffraction lines is smaller
in comparison with the powder milled only, suggesting the
increase of crystallite size and/or lattice strain decrease.

The Williamson-Hall plots for the samples after 50 h milling and
milling followed by DSC measurement are plotted in Fig. 2 (inset). It
was found that after heating the crystallite size of bcc solid solution
remains nearly the same (about 10 nm) and, simultaneously, lattice
strain decreases from 0.35 to 0.20%, comparing to milled powders
only (change of the slope of linear fit in Fig. 2, inset).

Fig. 3. Changes of bcc phase lattice parameter as a function of milling time and heat
treatment.

The powders after final milling time were subjected to chemical
composition analysis. Some amount of Fe (2.2 at%) was found as a
contamination coming from the milling media (balls and vial).

The changes of bcc phase lattice parameter as a function of pro-
cessing time are plotted in Fig. 3. At the early milling times, when
mainly Zr and V atoms dissolve in the W and Mo matrix, small
decrease of lattice parameter is observed. Such behavior can result
from the fact, that Zr and V reveal the smallest values of atomic
radii, 1.75 and 1.71 A, respectively, comparing to 1.93 A for W,
1.90 A for Mo and 1.98 A for Nb [11]. However, for longer milling
time the slight increase of its value can be noticed, related to fur-
ther distortion of the lattice. The final value of bcc solid solution
lattice parameter after 100 h MA (3.1687 A + 0.0005 A) is located
between the smallest one for V (3.0274 A) and the biggest one
for Nb (3.3033 A).

The value of bcc solid solution lattice parameter after calorimet-
ric measurement (3.1645 A) was clearly smaller than the one cal-
culated for powders milled only (Fig. 3). These changes of lattice
parameter during the heating can indicate that the structure
become more relaxed. Simultaneously, single phase bcc structure
and nanosize of crystallites are preserved, confirming good thermal
stability of this alloy resulting from the slow diffusion due to high
entropy of the system.

A question arises why the diffraction lines corresponding to bcc
solid solution formed upon milling are located in the vicinity of W/
Mo lines. The possible explanation can result from the fact, that W

and Mo reveal the highest melting point among the elements form-
ing this alloy and these elements also exhibit very high hardness.
Another reason can be related to the values of enthalpy of mixing.
Enthalpies of alloys formation for W and Mo with other elements
are negative (e.g. —13 kJ/mol for W-Nb, —14kJ/mol for W-Zr,
—9 kJ/mol for Mo-Nb), while for W-Mo this value is zero [12]. It
can facilitate earlier and easier dissolution of Nb, Zr and V in W
and Mo, as was observed in this work.

4. Conclusions

High melting point high entropy multicomponent WMoNbZrV
alloy has been successfully synthesized using mechanical alloying
process. The final powder revealed nanocrystalline single phase
bcc structure characterized by minimum crystallite size of about
10 nm, maximum lattice strain of 0.58% and lattice parameter
3.1687 A.

Continuous heating the powders after 50h of MA in the
calorimeter up to 700°C resulted in lattice strain decrease from
0.35 to 0.20%, while the crystallite size of bcc phase remained
unchanged (10 nm). The performed heat treatment also resulted
in a slight decreasing of bcc phase lattice parameter. These results
confirmed the high thermal stability of the alloy resulting from the
slow diffusion of elements due to high entropy of the system.
