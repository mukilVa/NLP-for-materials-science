Introduction

Rapidly developing technologies require the parallel develop-
ment of advanced materials with improved properties. Conven-
tional metal alloys, for example, cannot fulfill all the demands
of such technologies, motivating material scientists to continu-
ously develop new materials. One new class of materials with an
attractive combination of tunable mechanical and physical
properties are the High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs)."° HEAs are
multi-component materials composed of five or more elements
combined in an equimolar or near-equimolar ratio. HEAs
crystallize mainly in simple structures, such as face- or body-
centered cubic (FCC, BCC) or hexagonal-closed packed (HCP)
lattices with mixed site occupancy.° * In these solid-solutions, the
high mixing entropy contributes significantly to the free energy,
stabilizing the HEA phases at ambient temperatures.°”1"*

HEAs have attracted much interest in recent years. Among the
many studied systems only four examples of superconducting
HEAs have so far been reported. The first, Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti, ” ** is
a type-II bulk superconductor with a small unit cell BCC structure,
a maximum T, ~ 7.6 K for the composition [TaNb]o.¢7(HfZrTi)o.33,
an upper critical field for the quenching of superconductivity
HoH ez at zero temperature of 7.75 Tesla (T), and extraordinarily
robust zero-resistance superconductivity at pressures up to
190 GPa.’ In the next group, the CsCl structure is found, for
pentanary (ScZrNb),_,{RhPd],, and hexanary (ScZrNbTa),_,{RhPd],
with a maximum T, ~ 9.3 K and [igH,o(0) = 10.7 T.'° These HEA

superconductor systems display strong composition-dependent
changes in the superconducting transition temperature.
Finally, the nearly equimolar BCC HEA Nb ,Re1¢Zr29Hf23Tizg
with T, © 5.3 K and oH.2(0) = 8.88 T has been reported.”
Apparently, highly disordered BCC structures and their ordered
variants with CsCl-type lattices, with small unit cells, seem to
favor superconductivity in HEAs.

A rare, relatively complex structure type that is found for
some superconducting binary alloys is the o-Mn structure.
This structure derives from the low-temperature allotrope of
manganese and is body-centered cubic with a relatively large
crystallographic cell that contains many more atoms than the
simple BCC and CsCl-type structures found for previously
reported superconducting HEAs. These binary superconductors,
in space group /43m have 58 atoms per unit cell (rather than the
two atoms per cell found in simple BCC materials) occupying four
different symmetry sites, each of them with high coordination
numbers.’® Typical elements forming binary «Mn compounds
with the general sum formula A;B,, (two A;B,, formula units per
cell) are A: transition metal element or a rare earth element, and
B: Mn, Tc, Re or Os. For these binaries, intermetallic compounds
as well as solid solutions are reported. Although overall more
complex than the small-cell BCC or FCC structures typically
encountered for HEAs, the «-Mn structure type is also based on
closest packing of atoms, though local closest packing rather
than global closest packing dominates.’? Table 1 gives an
overview of the conventional rhenium-based binary intermetallic
a-Mn structure superconductors with T, > 2 K listed in order of
increasing VEC.””*

Here we present three previously unreported pentanary
HEA superconductors with rhenium. They are in the mixed
4d 5d system Zr-Nb-Mo-Re-Ru, and in the purely 5d systems

Experimental
Synthesis

All samples were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of
zirconium foil (99.8% purity), niobium pieces (99.99% purity),
tantalum (99.9% purity, arc-melted from powder), molybdenum
foil (99.95% purity), ruthenium pieces (99.9% purity, arc-melted
from powder), hafnium pieces (99.6% purity, arc-melted from
powder), tantalum foil (99.9% purity), tungsten foil (99.95%
purity), rhenium pieces (99.99% purity), and platinum pieces
(99.99% purity, arc-melted from powder) respectively, all from
Alfa Aesar. The elemental metals were carefully arc melted in 200
or 250 mg sample sizes into a single metallic button under an
argon atmosphere with a high current (JT > 2500 °C, J < 75 A) and
quenched on a water-chilled copper plate. The argon atmosphere
was cleaned of residual oxygen and moisture by co-heating of
a zirconium sponge at each melting step. The samples were
re-melted at least three times and turned over each time, to ensure
the optimal mixing of the constituents. Only samples with a weight
loss less than 1.5% were characterized. An overview of the samples
studied, with the normalized sum formulas, corresponding molar
composition, total weight loss from starting weight during pre-
paration, lattice parameter a of the o-Mn structure, and valence
electron concentrations (VECs, i.e. electrons per atom, e/a) is given
in Table 2. VECs only for single-phase samples are shown in the
table. No amorphous phases are present in the HEA samples,
because for such metallic systems cooling rates of several orders
of magnitude faster than those employed here would be required
to obtain an amorphous phase.

Crystallography

For qualitative structural characterization, powder X-ray
diffractometry (pXRD) was used. All samples are brittle and were
converted into powder form by grinding. The pXRD patterns
were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance Eco in Bragg-Bretano
Geometry with Cu-Ko-radiation and a LynxEye-XE detector.

LeBail fits for determining the average cell parameters of all
samples were performed using the TOPAS program package”®
with Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt peak shapes.

Physical property measurements

The magnetizations, resistivities and heat capacities were studied
on bulk sample pieces using a Quantum Design Physical
Property Measurement System (PPMS) DynaCool equipped with
a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) Option. Zero-field
cooled (ZFC) temperature dependent magnetization measure-
ments were carried in a field of oH = 2 mT. For the resistivity
measurements, a standard four-probe technique was used with
an applied current of J = 3 mA. The specific heat experiments
were carried out using a relaxation method in the temperature
interval of 15-1.8 K at zero applied magnetic field and 9 T.

Electron microscopy

Compositions were verified for selected materials by performing
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies on flat
sanded sample surfaces with the accelerating voltage of 15 kV
with a Quanta 200 FEG Environmental (FEI) scanning electron
microscope equipped with a X-Max 80 mm” SDD (Oxford
Instruments) spectrometer, collected and analyzed employing
the INCA suite of programs.

Results and discussion

Structural characterization of «-Mn type HEAs

(ZrNb),_,{MoReRu],. The high-temperature reaction of the
Ad transition metals zirconium, niobium, molybdenum and
ruthenium together with the 5d-metal rhenium with the general
sum formula (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu], forms, for 0.90 < x < 0.70,
brittle, silver-lustrous, polycrystalline materials that are stable
in air and moisture. The brittle character of these and the other
a-Mn type HEAs studied in this work is in stark contrast to the
ductile character of the small-cell superconducting BCC and
CsCl-type HEAs studied previously. Their pXRD patterns could
be indexed with the complex structure of the low-temperature
allotrope of manganese, i.e. a-Mn.'* The compounds crystallize
on a body-centered cubic lattice in space group 143m (Fig. 1)
whose unit cell contains 58 atoms occupying four different
Wyckoff sites: 2a (0,0,0), 8c (x,x,x), and 2 x 24g (x,x,z). The
coordination spheres of the atoms in each site reveal high
coordination numbers (CN) and can be described as distorted
4-fold capped truncated tetrahedra representing so called
Friauf-polyhedra with CN = 16 for sites 2a (less distorted) and
8c (more distorted), a polyhedron with CN = 13 whose faces are
19 triangles and one trapezoid for one 24¢ site, and a distorted
icosahedron for the other 24g site (CN = 12), all depicted in
Fig. 2.'° The «-Mn structure is built up by the interpenetration
of those four different coordination polyhedra, determined by
local closest packing of the vertices. Another way to describe
the structure is with polyhedral nesting: the atom on 2a (center
and the corner of the unit cell) is coordinated by twelve atoms
located on 24g forming a truncated tetrahedron with four

capped by four atoms sitting on 8c in a tetrahedral fashion
around the central atom. The last coordination sphere is built
up by the twelve atoms sitting on the second 24¢ site forming a
cuboctahedron.*? Within both structural principles, local dense
packing of atoms stabilizes the «-Mn structure type in the
studied HEA systems. The binary intermetallic structures deter-
mined in this structure type generally have a well-defined A;Bo,4
(ie. Ao.17Bo.g3) Stoichiometry with ordering of the two different
atom types; atom A found on Wykoff sites 2a and 8c, and atom
B on the two 24g sites.”° The solid solutions are non-stoichio-
metric A,B,_, compounds with either partial ordering on certain
sites, e.g. as in Rey ~Nby.4’’ and Reg, sNby.2, °° or complete random
mixing of the two elements on all four symmetry sites, as
reported e.g. for Reo.¢7Tao.33-> All binary o-Mn-structure super-
conducting alloys based on Re are Re-rich — that is, they contain
more than 50% Re and often much more; which is not the case
for the HEA superconductors studied here.

structure type that shows the compounds ability to form a solid
solution with certain mixing of the different metals on the
different sites. The large numbers of different atoms and the
large number of sites in this crystal structure means that an

our superconducting «-Mn HEAs is beyond the scope of the
present study, as it would require the co-refinement of several
sets of diffraction data designed such that the atoms have
different scattering factors. Just like the recently reported
CsCl-type HEAs,'® the new o-Mn HEAs are materials partway
between ordered intermetallic compounds and random solid
solution, and appear to be stabilized within a small composi-
tional range due to a delicate balance between maximizing the
mixing entropy and minimizing the mixing enthalpy.

The phase boundary of «-Mn type (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu], HEAs
for high x values is an HCP alloy of equimolar MoReRu with
mixed site occupancy (Fig. 1). This material is superconducting
at T, © 9.1 K. For low x values, i.e. x < 0.70, two BCC phases
with slightly different lattice parameters [a, = 3.176(1) A,
dz = 3.211(1) A] are found in addition to the o-Mn-type HEA
alloy, and, with further increase of the Zr/Nb content the target
compound is not formed any more but the hexagonal Laves

tuents, ie. alloys with lower mixing entropy.

cannot be determined unambiguously for a system with 5
elements present by employing only one type of diffraction.
In both HEA systems, elemental rhenium starts to separate
out for high x-values in addition to the target phase (Fig. 3a
and b). On the other side, the phase boundary for the o#-Mn
type (HfTaWIr),_,[{Re], phase at low x-values is a BCC phase

The (HffaWIr),_,{Re], compounds are stable in air and
moisture. In contrast, the (HfTaWPt),_,{Re], samples start to
decompose after approximately seven days in air, changing
color from lustrous silver to black while emitting a dark colored
liquid with pH ~ 2. Although the crystal structure of the bulk of
the aged samples seems not to change according to pXRD
measurements (no peak shift, no broadening, no splitting, no
intensity loss), the examination of the microstructure and the
chemical composition of the surface of a decomposed initially
phase-pure o«-Mn-type HEA (HfTaWPt)o.40[Re]o.c6o, exemplary
of the Pt-variant compounds, using SEM and EDX, revealed
significant differences compared to an as-synthesized bulk
sample of the same age (stored in the inert Ar-atmosphere
of a glove box) of the same composition and crystal structure:
the as-synthesized (HfTaWPt)o.40[Relo.co sample shows the
flat, smooth surface of a metallic nugget without a visible
microstructure under our imaging conditions, homogeneous
distribution of all five elements, and a stoichiometry in
good agreement with the initial element composition [EDX:

Fig. S1, ESI+]. In contrast, the surface of the decomposed
(HfTaWPt)o.40o[Re]o.co material displays a remarkable, porous
microstructure, reminiscent of de-alloying.*°** It shows sub-
micrometer dendrites that are significantly Hf/Pt-rich (EDX: Hf:
43.2 at% and Pt: 56.8 at%, Fig. $2, ESI+) that form on the
surface of the remaining bulk alloy. The characterization of the
slow decomposition of the superconducting (HfTaWIr),_,,{Re],
HEA material and the accumulation of a dendritic Hf/Pt-rich
phase on its surface is beyond the scope of the current work
and may be of interest for future studies.

 

Composition dependence of the superconducting transition
temperature and heat capacity in the a-Mn type HEAs

The superconducting properties of the «-Mn type HEAs were
generally characterized through zero-field cooled (ZFC) temperature-
dependent magnetization measurements. The magnetization
curves for the three «-Mn type HEA superconducting materials
(ZrNb),_,[MoReRu],, (HfTaWIr),_,{Re], and (HfTaWPt),_,[{Re],
for samples with different compositions were measured from
1.7 K to 8 K or 10 K (Fig. 4a-c). The susceptibility y for all samples
in the superconducting state, except for (HfTaWIr)o 7[Re]o,3, whose
superconducting transition is not complete above 1.7 K, is
more negative than —1, the ideal diamagnetic response for
superconducting materials. This common phenomenon is
caused by demagnetization effects. For a better comparison,

transitions in y(T) for all investigated «-Mn type HEAs samples
are well defined in temperature and exhibit a steep slope,
except for (HfTaWIr)o.3o[Re]o.70 (Fig. 4b, green curve), whose
transition is broad; this breadth can be explained as due to
small chemical inhomogeneities in this sample.

The temperature-dependent magnetization curves reveal a
dramatic change of the T for small variations of the HEAs’
composition. For all three HEA series, T, increases with increasing x,
which correlates with increasing Re-content and decreasing
lattice constant a of the cubic «-Mn structure. The maximum
transition temperatures can be found for x = 0.90, with T, = 5.3 K
in the (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu], series, for x = 0.80 with T, = 5.9 K in
the (HfTaWIr),_,{Re], series, and for x = 0.80 with T, = 6.3 K in
the (HfTaWPt),_,{Re], series. Although the latter two materials
of the 5d-element HEA series are not phase-pure, as they have
started to segregate out elemental rhenium (Fig. 3a and b; violet
curves), the decrease of their lattice parameter a still indicates a
systematic change of the materials composition near these limits
(see Table 2). In addition, elemental Re is not superconducting.

The lattice-parameter-dependent change of the super-
conducting transition temperature T,(a) for the new «-Mn type
(ZrNb),_,{MoReRu],, (HffaWIr),_,{Re], and (HfTaWPt),_ [Re],
HEAs, shown in Fig. 5a, reveals a linear increase of the T,
with decreasing lattice constant for all these o-Mn type HEA
materials. The (HffaWPt),_,{Re],, HEA shows the largest change of
T, as a function of the lattice parameter: while (HfTaWPt)o.50[Re]o.so
for example is superconducting at around 2.4 K, a decrease of a
by less than 1% causes a significant increase of the T, up to
~6.3 K for x = 0.8. In addition, the valence electron count
dependency of the superconducting transition temperatures of
the phase-pure «-Mn type (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu],, (HfTaWIr),_ [Re]
and (HffaWPt),_,{Re], HEA samples shows a monotonic and
almost linear trend for all three systems (Fig. 5b, black squares,
red triangles, blue circles). With increasing VEC the T, increases.
This kind of behavior falls in between the trend lines found for
crystalline transition metals and their binary alloys and inter-
metallic compounds, known as the Matthias rule (Fig. 5b, dark
blue trend line),*” and for amorphous transition metal alloy
films, reported by Collver and Hammond (Fig. 5b, light blue
trend line).** Compared to the benchmarks of Matthias, which
show maxima near VECs of 5 and 7 e/a, and Collver and
Hammond’s trend line, which shows a monotonic increase of
the superconducting transition temperature with increasing
VEC, reaching a maximum around 6.4 e/a, the T, vs. VEC
behavior of the superconducting o«-Mn type HEA series show
intermediate slopes with maximum values around 6.75 e/a.
These VEC values match those displayed by the compositions of
the binary rhenium alloys with «-Mn type structure that exhibit
the highest Ts, i.e. MoRe; (T. = 9.9 K) and WRe; (T; = 9.0 K)®
(Table 1). In addition, the T, vs. VEC trends of the «-Mn type
HEAs match the one of their binary isostructural relatives
(Fig. 5b, green trend line). It must be noted that the trend lines
of all three «-Mn type HEA series do not reveal distinct maxima as
a structural phase separation occurs for compositions with higher
VECs. In contrast to the foregoing findings, the CsCl-type HEA
superconductors (ScZrNb),_,{RhPd], and (ScZrNbTa),_,{RhPd],.

The o-Mn type (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu],, (HffaWIr),_,{Re], and
(HfTaWPt), _,{Re], HEA superconductors were also studied
by measuring their heat capacity C(T) in order to gain more
information about the nature of the superconductivity.

defined transitions, which occur at 5.3 K, 4.0 K, and 4.4 K
respectively. These temperatures are consistent with the results
from the susceptibility measurements (compare Table S1, ESI‘),
and confirm the presence of a single superconducting phase.

the AC/yT, ratios were obtained (Table $1, ESI), and are very
close to the standard weak-coupling BSC value, i.e. AC/yT, = 1.43.
Thus, all three «-Mn HEAs are bulk superconductors that exhibit
weak-coupling superconductivity. For more details we refer
readers to the ESI.+

Resistivity and upper critical fields of the 4-Mn type HEAs

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity p(T) of the HEA
superconductors (ZrNb)o.19[ MoReRu]o.90, (HfTaWIr)o.10[Re]o.60;
and (HfTaWPt)o.1o[Re]o.60 Measured between 300 K and 1.7 K
are shown in Fig. 6d-f. The normal-state resistivity data of all
three materials reveals poor metallic behavior, with linear, only
slightly decreasing p(T) as a function of decreasing temperature.
The room temperature (RT) resistivities are 105, 536, and
591 wQ cm, respectively, and very small residual resistivity ratio
(RRR) values close to 1.00 are observed (compare Table S1,
ESI). The nearly temperature independent behavior of the
resistivity and the high p(RT) values can be compared to
the electron transport properties of strongly disordered alloys

and intermetallic compounds, as well as metallic glasses,
where the scattering is caused by small domain size and
atomic-scale disorder.

All three HEA superconductors (ZrNb)o.1o[ MoReRu]o.90;
(HfTaWIr)o.40/Re]o.60, and (HfTaWPt)o.40[Re]lo.6o reveal sharp
transitions to the zero-resistance state according to their zero-
field resistivity curves. The critical temperatures, 1. T.resistivitys
which were determined as the midpoints of the p(T) plots,
are consistent with the results from the magnetization and
specific heat measurement (compare Table $1, ESI+). Only the
Te,resistivity Of (ZTNb)o.1o0[ MoReRu]o.90 from the transport experi-
ment is, at 5.74 K, slightly higher than the value estimated from
the temperature dependent magnetization (TJ. ~ 5.3 K). This
common observation can be attributed to the higher sensitivity
of the transport measurement to filamentary or surface super-
conductivity, which may appear at a slightly higher temperature
than the bulk transition.

The upper critical fields oH-2(T) were determined by applying
the 50%-criterion to the resistivity data, ie. T. is taken as the

temperature where 50% of the normal-state resistivity is
suppressed, measured from the field dependent p(T) curves
in the proximity of the superconducting transition (Fig. S4,
ESI). The temperature dependent critical fields oHe2(T) of
(ZrNb)o.1o[ MoReRu]o,90, (HfTaWIr)o.4o[RE]o.60. and (HfTaWPt)o.40-
[Re]lo.6o are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI+). The approximation of the
upper critical field at zero temperature {oH.2(0) of the three
different «-Mn type HEA superconductors was performed by
using the slopes dH,./dT of the linear region of 9H-2(T) for the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression in the dirty
limit** according to the formula

djig He
lig Heo (0) = —0.693Te 2 (1)

 

The obtained critical fields at zero temperature revealed
relatively high zero temperature upper critical fields, of 7.86 T
for (ZrNb)o.19[ MoReRu]o.90, 4.64 T for (HfTaWIr)o.40[Re]o.60, and
5.90 T for (HfTaWPt)o.40[ Re ]o.6o-

Summary and conclusions

We have synthesized previously unreported High-Entropy Alloys
in the pentanary systems (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu],, (HfTaWIr),_ ,{Rel,,
and (HfTaWPt),_,{Re], by arc-melting of the 4d- and 5d-transition
metals. These new materials have body-centered cubic «-Mn-type
structures and mixed site occupancies. Although the phase
width for phase-pure samples is small for all three HEA series,
the decrease of the lattice parameter a in samples with emerging
impurity phases still indicates a systematic compositional
change of the «Mn type compounds. Whether the materials
form a solid solution where all constituent elements mix
randomly on all four crystallographic positions or if a certain
ordering of the different metals on one or more symmetry site is
existent cannot be determined unambiguously for a system with
5 elements of very similar electron count present and with
conventional laboratory XRD data. The (ZrNb),_,{MoReRu],,
(HfTaWIr),_,{Re],, and (HfTaWPt),_,{Re], HEAs are materials
partway between ordered intermetallic compounds and random
solid solutions stabilized within a small compositional range
due to a delicate balance between the system’s attempt to
maximize the mixing entropy and minimizing the mixing
enthalpy. The structure of these materials is quite a bit more
complex than is found for the small-cell BCC superconducting
HEAs, although the «-Mn structure type can be understood
as a consequence of local closest packing, a straightforward
structural principle. The presence of Re in significant proportion
appears to be significant for the stabilization of the «-Mn-type
although for the mixed 4d 5d system the Re is present at a much
lower concentration than is typically found in binary alloys in
this structure type, suggesting an entropic stabilization of this
structure. The two purely 5d-metal based superconducting HEAs
are the first of their kind.
