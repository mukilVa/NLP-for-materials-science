Alloying is an effective method to strengthen high entropy alloys (HEAs). Unfortunately, most of the
investigations focus on the perspective of experiments and few are available from the perspective of
atomic and electrical scale such as electronic structure, energy band structure and charge density. In
present work, first-principle calculation based on density functional theory was employed to calculate
the ground state total energy, lattice parameters, elastic constants and polycrystal modulus of NbMoTaW
and NbMoTaWYV refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs). The effects of V addition on the phase structure,
elastic properties and electronic structure of NbMoTaW-based RHEAs were studied, respectively. V
addition is helpful to improve the mechanical properties of NbMoTaW alloy according to the calculated
value of shear modulus to bulk modulus, Cauchy pressure and Vickers hardness. Based on calculated
energy band, electronic state density, charge density and charge density difference, V addition is found to
shorten the pseudo-energy gap and enhance interaction force between Mo and W atoms. This tends to
improve the mechanical properties of the alloy. The calculated results were in good agreement with the
experimental data, demonstrating that the methods were effective in predicting the performance of

RHEAs.

1. Introduction

High entropy alloys (HEAs) [1], as well as named as multi-
principal component alloy, is a new type of superalloy, which are
composed of five or more elements with equal or near equal atomic
ratio. Unlike the predicted results by traditional alloy theory and
Gibbs phase law, HEAs do not form multiphase compounds which
weaken the properties of materials for existing many elements. On
the contrary, because the high entropy effect hinders the formation
of brittle phases such as intermetallic compounds, HEAs show
excellent “collective characteristics” [2]. Compared with the tradi-
tional alloys, HEAs have single-phase BCC, FCC or HCP structure,
attracting extensive attentions for their high strength, high hard-
ness, high wear resistance, excellent high temperature oxidation
resistance, corrosion resistance, superior thermal stability and
other comprehensive properties [3—7]. In particular, refractory high

entropy alloys (RHEAs), constituted of refractory elements such as
Nb, Ta, Mo, W, are considered to be new superalloys for high
temperature applications because of their superior mechanical
strength at elevated temperatures compared with Ni-based alloys
and Ni3Al-based intermetallic and other superalloys [8,9]. They
have broad potential applications as a structural material in avia-
tion, aerospace, metallurgy, nuclear energy and other fields of high
temperature resistance due to their high melting points (above
2000 °C), high strength and excellent high temperature resistance
[10].

The newly Moz5Nb25Ta25W25 RHEA, which is completely
composed of refractory metal elements, has been reported for the
first time by Senkov in 2010 [11]. The compressive strength of
Mozs5Nb25Taz5W25 RHEA is 1211 MPa at room temperature and
405 MPa at 1600 °C, respectively. Importantly, it still has a stable
single-phase BCC structure at 1400 °C. The surprised results
demonstrate that it is a new type of high temperature structural
material for its excellent high temperature resistance and high
temperature strength. To meet the increasing demand for high
performance structural materials in high temperature applications,
2 Y.L. Hu et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 827 (2020) 153963

it is of great significance to further improve the mechanical prop-
erties of Moz5Nb25Taz5W25 RHEA. Alloying is an effective and
common method to improve the mechanical properties of alloys.
For example, Wang et al. found that Al addition resulted in the
formation of BCC structure and hardened Al,CoCrFeNi high entropy
alloys [12]. Salishchev et al. found V addition could improve
significantly CoCrFeNi-based high entropy alloy’s hardness from
160 Hv to 524 Hv and the compressive yield strength from
6902 = 190 MPa—1435 MPa [13]. Especially, V addition was
demonstrated to be effectively improve the mechanical properties
of NbMoTaW RHEA such as improving the compressive yield
strength from o92 = 1058 MPa—1246 MPa based on the experi-
ments [11]. Xin et al. prepared single-phase nanocrystalline (NC)
refractory VNbMoTaW HEAs and found its hardness reaches
11.4 GPa at 1150 °C [14]. Unfortunately, as far as we know, most of
the research about NbDMoTaW RHEA are focusing on experiments.
There are few theoretical calculations to reveal the alloying me-
chanical strengthening of NoMoTaW RHEA. No publish information
is available on performances enhancement from the perspective of
atomic and electrical scale such as electronic structure, band
structure and charge density.

First-principles, as an effective and economic calculational tool,
is widely employed to predict material properties from atomic
scale. In this work, the crystal model of NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV
RHEA were built based on virtual crystal approximate method
(VCA) [15—18] and special quasi-random supercell method (SQS)
[19]. The ground total energy, phase structure, mechanical prop-
erties as well as electronic structure including the band structure,
electronic density of states, charge density and charge density
difference were systematically calculated to reveal the effects of V
alloying on the properties of NoMoTaW-based RHEA. In addition,
the similarities and differences of these methods including VCA and
SQS in the computational accuracy and performance prediction for
disordered high entropy alloys were compared.

 

2. Methods
2.1. Theoretical methods and calculation models

Fig. 1 is the unoptimized VCA model and SQS supercell model of
NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA, respectively. In this work, a se-
ries of supercell model containing 4, 10, 20 and 10 atoms were built,
and they were expanded to 1 x 1 x 2and1 x 1 x 5onthe basis of a
single cell. All the calculations were performed using CASTEP
module, which depended on the first-principle plane-wave pseu-
dopotential method based on density functional theory (DFT). The
crystal models were respectively established by VCA and SQS
methods. The electronic exchange-correlation terms were
described using Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and
Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) function. Norm conserving pseu-
dopotential for all the elements in reciprocal space were applied.
The valence electrons of all the elements are Nb 4d‘45s!, Mo 4d°s!,
Ta 5d?6s*, W 5d‘6s?, and V 3d?4s~. The cutoff energy (Ecut) of plane
and special k-points sampling integration over the Brillouin zone
were adopted using Monkhorst-Pack method according to the
system defaults corresponding to fine-quality. Namely, E,yt was set
to be 450 eV. K-point meshes of different models were set to be
8 x 8 x 4 for BCC NbMoTaW, 8 x 8 x 2 for BCC NbMoTaWV,
6 x 6 x 1 for FCC NbMoTaWV, 10 x 10 x 1 for HCP NbMoTaWV and
8 x 8 x 8 for BCC NbMoTaWV built by VCA method, respectively.
Partially, the k-point mesh was set to be 8 x 8 x 3 during the elastic
constant calculation of the SQS supercell model. The structure
optimization of above models adopted Broyden Flecher Goldfarb
Shanno (BFGS) scheme. The maximal geometry optimization iter-
ations step is 100. Pulay density mixing method was used in self-
consistent calculation (SCF). The self-consistent convergence con-
ditions were as follows: the total energy was 1 x 10~° eV/atom, the
force less than 0.03 eV/A, the tolerance displacement less than
0.001 A, and the stress less than 0.05 GPa. The single-point energy,

elastic and electronic properties of all the models were finally
calculated after cell optimization.

In order to verify the accuracy of the above parameters, the
lattice parameters of single-phase BCC NbMoTaW RHEA was
calculated to be 3.193 A, which was well agreed with the calculated
value (3.271 A) by Li [20] and the experimental value (3.213 A) by
Senkov [21]. It is demonstrated that the above parameters during
calculations are reasonable.

3. Experimental

NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA were prepared by vacuum arc
melting after equimolar mixing corresponding elements with a pu-
rity of 99.9 wt%. Before melting, the furnace was vacuumed to
3 x 10-7 Pa and then, high purity argon gas was injected into the
furnace. The alloy ingots were repeatedly melted 5 times to ensure
the uniformity of their composition and structure. The specimens
were cut from the ingots using wire electrical discharge machining.
The structures of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2550VB-) using Cu Ke radiation at a scanning
rate of 5°/min and scanning from 26 = 20°—90°. Microhardness of
the alloys was measured by Vickers hardness tester. Getting an
average value among three different points under 100 g for 15s.

4. Results and discussion
4.1, Phase structure

Normally, the empirical criterions are used to predict the phase
structure of RHEA. According to the literatures [22], when the
average valence electron concentration (VEC) is larger than 8, FCC
phase is stable. If VEC<6.87, BCC phase is stable. BCC and FCC phase
coexist between 6.87 and 8. Besides, atomic size difference (6<6.6%)
is considered as a single-phase BCC solid solution. The values of VEC
and 6 for NbMoTaWV RHEA calculated using the empirical crite-
rions are 5.463 (<6.87) and 3.20% (<6.6%), respectively, indicating
that the NbMoTaWV RHEA is a single-phase BCC structure.

Table 1 shows the formation enthalpy (Eform) and cohesive en-
ergy (Econ) calculated based on the optimized SQS model of
NbMoTaWV RHEA. Table 2 shows the total energy (Esoliq) of a single
cell for every component in NbMoTaWV RHEA and total energy
(Eatom) of individual atom in a corresponding single cell, respec-
tively. Formation enthalpy plays a crucial role to characterize the
ability of forming metal compounds. Generally speaking, the more
negative formation enthalpy is liable to form metal compounds.
The cohesive energy is used to determine the stability of the crystal.
The lower the cohesive energy, the more stable the crystals [23].
The Eform and Econ of NbMoTaWV RHEA were respectively calcu-
lated based on formula (1) and (2):

In the formula (1) and (2), Etot is the total energy of optimized
NbMoTaWV RHEA SQS model. a, b, c, d and e represent the
atomic numbers of Nb, Mo, Ta, W and V in the corresponding
crystal cell, respectively. EN¥.,, EMO, E744, EWi4, Evuig are the
total energy of a single crystal cell for every component in

NbMoTaWV RHEA and EN? EMO Ele Ew nm Evtom are the
total energy of individual atom in a corresponding single crystal
cell, respectively. From the data in Table 1, we can see that both
Eform and Ecoh of BCC NbMoTaWV RHEA are negative. There is a
slight difference of Egg, among BCC, FCC, and HCP. BCC structure
with more negative Efoym and E,o,will be formed in the first time.
The calculated data indicates that NbDMoTaWV RHEA is single-
phase BCC structure.

In order to further analyze the phase structure of NbMoTaWV
RHEA, the theoretical XRD spectrum of the NbMoTaW and
NbMoTaWV RHEA from 20 = 20°—90° were calculated using
Powder Diffraction in Material Studio’s Reflex module. Fig. 2 shows
the theoretical and experimental XRD spectrums of both RHEA in
this work. It is obviously observed that the strong peak positions
in calculated XRD spectrum using VCA and SQS methods are well
consistent with the experimental results, which indicates that
NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA formed a single-phase BCC solid
solution. Besides, neutron diffraction patterns of both RHEA were
measured and also exhibited a single-phase BCC solid solution
[11], which were well agreed with our experimental and calculated
results. Interestingly, the tendency of strong peak moving to the
high angle demonstrated that the lattice parameters of NbMo-
TaWV RHEA reduced after the addition of V atom with relatively
small atomic size.

The calculated lattice parameters of NbMoTaW and NbMo-
TaWV RHEA in the present work are shown in Table 3. It can be
seen that the decreasing tendency of calculated lattice parameter
is similar to the analytical results of XRD spectrum. It is easy to
be seen that V addition reduces the lattice parameters of the
alloy. The phenomenon should be attributed to existg atomic size
difference.

In summary, NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA are single-phase
BCC solid solution based on the analysis of empirical criterions,
formation enthalpy, cohesive energy and XRD spectrum. Therefore,
BCC NbMoTaWV RHEA suppercell model was adopted to calculate
the elastic properties and electronic structure.

4.2. Elastic properties

Table 4 shows nine elastic constants of optimized NbMoTaW and
NbMoTaWV RHEA. Generally, the crystals with body centered cubic
structure have three independent elastic constants. There are nine
independent elastic constants in the suppercell model we adopted.
Therefore, we took the average value of the elastic constants ob-
tained by SQS model in order to reduce the influence of SQS model’s
low symmetry and large size [24,25]. The results of calculated
average value of the elastic constants shown in Table 5, which were
described as formula (3):

According to Born Rule [16], formula (4) is identified as the
decisive condition of mechanical stability:

Cy1 > 0, Cyg>0, (C1 —Ci2) > 0, Cqy + 2C42 >0 (4)

On the basis of the calculated data, we draw a conclusion that
NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA were of mechanical stability.

modulus decrease after V addition into NDMoTaW RHEA. In addi-
tion, it is easy to build models with fast calculating speed using the
VCA method, while the SQS model is complex and time-consuming.

The influence of V addition on the brittle-ductility of Nb MoTaWw
HEA is usually judged by the ratio of shear modulus to bulk
modulus (G/B). If G/B < 0.57, it shows ductility, and the smaller the
G/B is, the better the ductility is. Otherwise, it exhibits brittle
behavior [26]. The calculated G/B values of NoMoTaW and NbMo-
TaWV RHEA are listed in Table 5. It can be seen that the G/B value of
NbMoTaW (VCA: 0.413 and SQS: 0.390) and NbMoTaWV (VCA:
0.398 and SQS: 0.369) are basically same, indicating that both the
alloys have similar ductility. The above information is well agreed
with the nearly same compressing strain of NbNMoTaWV (1.9%) and
NbMoTaW RHEAs (1.7%) tested by Senkov [11]. Normally, Cauchy
pressure (Cj2—Cy4) is often used to evaluate the bonding charac-
teristics of the alloy. If the (Cj2—C,4,) is positive, the metal bond will
be formed, otherwise, the covalent bond will be formed. Cauchy
pressure of the two alloys are shown in Table 5. All the values of
(Cy2—C44) are positive, indicating that the atoms in the alloys are
bonded by metal bonds.

Hardness can reflect the comprehensive mechanical properties
of materials. Thus, hardness of the NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaW
RHEAs were calculated to investigate the effect of V addition on the
mechanical properties of NoMoTaW RHEA. Generally, microhard-
ness (Hv) of alloys can be predicted through calculated bulk
modulus and shear modulus according to formula (5):

G3 0.585
Hv=|2~x (F2) —3 (5)

The predicted and experimental hardness of NbMoTaW and
NbMoTaWV RHEA are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that V addition
has a little improvement on the hardness of NbMoTaW RHEA.
Obviously, the predicted hardness values of the alloy are well
consistent with the experimental values [21]. Compared with the

experimental values [9,19] theoretical values [18]

experimental value of 5.250 GPa [21], the predicted hardness of
NbMoTaWV RHEA is 5.214 GPa in the present work. The deviation is
only 0.69%, which demonstrates that the special quasi-random
supercell method combined with the first principle based on den-
sity functional theory is feasible to predict the elastic constants,
polycrystalline modulus and hardness of disordered high-entropy
alloys.

4.3. Electronic structure

Fig. 4 shows the energy band structure of NbMoTaW and
NbMoTaWV RHEA along with the highly symmetric direction of
Brillouin region. The red dotted line in the figure represents the
position of Fermi energy level. The energy band structure near the
Fermi level is closely related to the material properties. As shown in
Fig. 4 (a) and (b), the energy gap is zero due to the overlap between
conduction band and valence band, which demonstrates that both
RHEAs show metal characteristics. Compared with NbMoTaWw
RHEA, NbMoTaWV RHEA has a compacted energy band, which may
be attributed to the strong interaction of orbital electrons between
V atom and other four atoms. The energy band overlapping in-
creases significantly after V addition into NoMoTaW RHEA, indi-
cating that V addition enhances the bonding strength of the alloy
system.

Fig. 5 shows the total and partial densities of states of NNMoTaW
and NbMoTaWV RHEA. It can be seen that there is no significant
difference in the total density of states between NbMoTaW and
NbMoTaWV RHEA, indicating that V addition makes the phase
structure of NbMoTaW alloy stable. There is no phase transition in
NbMoTaW RHEA after V addition. One difference is that V addition
makes the strong peak sharper and closer to the Fermi energy level.
Another change is that the conduction bond in high energy region

becomes flatter and more compact, indicating that strong interac-
tion of orbital electrons after V addition into NDMoTaW RHEA and V
addition makes the bonds combine sufficiently. The strong peak
energies near the Fermi energy level of NbMoTaW RHEA
are —2.36ev and 2.69eV and NbMoTaWV RHEA are —0.802eV and
3.12eV. That is to say, the pseudo-energy gaps of NbMoTaW and
NbMoTaWV RHEA are 5.05eV and 3.922eV, respectively. The
pseudo-energy gap, which is defined as the energy difference be-
tween two strong peaks near the Fermi energy level, reflecting the
covalency of the alloy system. The wider the pseudo-energy gap is,
the stronger the covalency of the system is [28,29]. The calculated
results are that V addition makes the valence band closer to Fermi
level apparently and the conduction bond flatter and more
compact, shortening the pseudo-energy gap in quaternary RHEA.
That is to say, the number of covalent bonds among Nb, Mo, Ta, W
atoms decrease after V addition into NbMoTaW alloy, which may
lead to the increasing of metallic bonding. It is thought to enhance
the bonding strength and improve NbMoTaW RHEA’s mechanical
properties. The analytical consequence is well consistent with the
results judged by Cauchy stress and energy bonds. In addition, the
total density of states of NoMoTaWV RHEA is far more than that of
NbMoTaW RHEA, indicating that NoMoTaWV has stronger metallic
properties than NbMoTaW.

In order to further understand the contribution of electrons of
each element to the total density of states of the alloy, the partial
density of states of each element of NbDMoTaW and NbMoTaWV
RHEA was calculated and is shown in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the
valence band near the Fermi energy level of NbMoTaW alloy, with a
high overlap rate, is formed after hybridization of d-orbital electron
of Nb, Mo, Ta and W. There are a few contribution originated from s-
orbital electron of Nb, Mo, Ta and W atoms. The conduction band of
NbMoTaWYV alloy is formed after the hybridization of d-orbital and
p-orbital electron among Nb, Mo, Ta, W and V atoms. Compared
with the partial density of states of NoOMoTaW RHEA, the conduc-
tion bond with less peak valley in high energy region of NDMoTaWV

RHEA becomes more compact, meaning that the interactions in
atoms become stronger.

Fig. 6 shows the charge density and charge density difference
diagram of NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA along the crystal
plane (110), which can directly reflect the bonding and charge
transfer between atoms. As shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), the electron
cloud distributes uniformly around Nb, Mo, Ta and W atoms
without obvious directionality, which verifies the formation of
metal bonds [30]. It is obvious that the overlap of the electron cloud
between Mo and W become stronger and take place stronger
electron interaction after V addition. Fig. 5 (c) and (d) are the charge
density difference diagrams. The red means losing electrons and
the blue represents getting electrons. It is easy to be seen that the
red around V atom is brighter than other atoms, indicating that V
atom loses electrons and the interaction of orbitals electrons

between V atom and Nb, Mo, Ta and W is stronger than that among
Nb, Mo, Ta and W. This may be the reason why the formed covalent
bonds between Nb, Mo, Ta and W decrease and the metal bonds
increase.

5. Conclusion

VCA and SQS models based on first-principle calculation were
used to calculate the phase structure, mechanical properties and
electronic structure of NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA. The
calculated Eform, Ecoh, and XRD spectrum indicate that both RHEAs
were single-phase BCC solid solution. According to the calculated
electronic structures, V addition enhanced the bonding strength
and improved mechanical properties of NbMoTaW RHEA. Both
NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RHEA exhibited metal characteristics.

The calculated results and the experimental data are coincident,
indicating that first-principle calculation is an effective method to
simulate and predict the properties of RHEA. This provides an
approach to investigate the alloying enhancement of RHEAs and
other alloys.
