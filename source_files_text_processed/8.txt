Electric current assisted sintering (ECAS) can be a new production method for high entropy alloy production due
to its advantages such as low sintering temperature and short holding time. In this study, production of
CoCrFeNiAlxTiy alloys (x:0.5, y:0,05, 1; y:0.5, x:0, 1) was carried out in electric current activated/assisted
sintering system in open air with a uniaxial contact pressure of 35 MPa at 2500 A for 5 min. Microstructural and
micro hardness properties of samples are determined. After sintering, depending on the composition, solid so-
lution phases such as FCC (FeNi), BCC (FeCr) were formed in all alloys. In alloys other than CoCrFeNiAl os, sigma
and Al-Ni-Ti intermetallic phases are formed. According to SEM-EDS analyses, the elements with high negative
mixing enthalpy are gathered together and the dark phases are enriched from the Al-Ni-Ti, while the Fe-Cr is
precipitated due to its high concentration around this phase. Thanks to intermetallic phases formed by the lattice
distortion of Al and Ti elements with high atomic radius, the hardness was obtained as 401 H V in CoCrFeNiAlo.5
alloy and 700HV in CoCrFeNiAlo 5Tio.5 alloy. Alloys were subjected to homogenization heat treatment at
1200 °C for 18h after sintering. As a result of homogenization, the increase in the formation of sigma phase is
generally multiplied. While the microstructure distribution became more homogeneous by annealing, an in-
crease in the lattice parameters of the phases was generally observed. Hardness values increased up to 496 H V in
the CoCrFeNiAl,.5 alloy and 956H V in the CoCrFeNiAlo.5Tio.5 alloy due to the increase in distortion and high
hardness sigma phase due to the increase of the lattice parameters.

High entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted extensive research at-
tention in the past decade because of their unusual properties [1-5].
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of materials which was first
introduced by Yeh et al. and by Cantor et al., in 2004 [6,7]. Unlike
traditional alloys, HEAs contain at least five principal elements with
each having elemental concentration between 5 and 35 at.% [8-16]. It
has been experimentally determined that each alloying element, with
its own crystalline structure, atomic ratio and melting point, has a di-
rect effect on the physical and chemical properties of the alloy [17].
The term “high-entropy” is based on the hypothesis that the high
mixing entropy of these compositionally complex alloys can overcome
the enthalpies of compound formation, i.e., favor the formation of a
single solid solution with face-centered cubic (FCC) and/or body-cen-
tered cubic (BCC) structures [9,18-24]. The majority of reported HEA
compositions are based on the transition metals, namely Co, Cr, Fe and
Ni, with addition of elements like Al, Cu, Mn, V, Ti and Mo [9].

dustrial manufacturing due to the disadvantages of economy, segrega-
tion problem and limitations in shape and size of final products [17,25].
To produce high entropy alloys, the pressure-assisted electric current
activated sintering (ECAS) method may be an alternative method. The
use of ECAS for consolidating samples not only provides a faster heating
time and shorter dwell time but also gives lower sintering temperatures.
In this technique, an electric current is applied simultaneously with a
mechanical pressure to consolidate or synthesize and to densify specific
products into a desired configuration and density [26-31].

With the aim to explore alternative routes to synthesize high en-
tropy alloys and improve their performance, in this work we focused on
the high-entropy alloy system of CoCrFeNiAl,Ti, synthesized by ECAS,
and studied on the alloying behavior, microstructure and hardness
properties. Furthermore, the main purpose is to produce this kind of
alloys in minimum possible time and temperature with ECAS technique.
In this way we aimed to save energy consumption for a clean

CoCrFeNiAlo.s5Ti, CoCrFeNiTij.5 and CoCrFeNiAITig.5 (Table 2) were
ball milled for 5 h at 250 rpm in air atmosphere. Methanol was added as
a process control agent to inhibit the particle agglomeration. In order to
provide the contacts between individual powders in the initial period of
the process, the samples were pressed with a die with a compression
load of 250 MPa for 1 min. Dimensions of the compact were 15mm in
diameter and 3mm in thickness. After obtaining the samples, direct
electric current (2500 A, 1.2-1.8 V) was applied to the specimen with a
pressure of 50 MPa for 5min using the electric-current-activated sin-
tering technique in an open-atmosphere ECAS system, as shown in
Fig. 1. In order to easily remove the sample after sintering, the punches
and the specimens were separated by graphite foils of 0.2mm in
thickness. After the sintering, the specimens were unloaded and cooled
to room temperature. The sintered alloys were annealed at 1200 °C for
18h in argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation and cooled in furnace.

The method used in this paper is electric current assisted sintering
(ECAS) technique. Here, the electric current is mainly based on the
principle of sintering the sample passing through green body compacts
or powders, and are generally conducted with simultaneously an ad-
ditional pressure application. The pressure of 35 MPa is applied to

provide contact between powders. In this method, the powder or
compact material is heated in the container to the desired temperature
and then the sintering process is terminated by taking the pressure
back. Heat is generated by the Joule effect.

The crystal structure of the as-preserved alloys prepared was ex-
amined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, RIGAKU D/MAX/2200/PC) with
a wavelength of 1.5418 A over a 20 range of 10-80° with CuKa ra-
diation. The microstructures of the alloys were observed using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MAIA3 XMU). Micro hardness
measurements were performed using a Vickers microhardness tester
(QNESS Q10 M) under a load of 100 g for 10s. Five measurements were
made for each sample to obtain the averaged experimental data.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD analyses as-sintered CoCrFeNiAlxTiy alloys

After ECAS process, XRD patterns, belongs to as-sintered alloys, are
shown in Fig. 2, and the identified phases with their lattice parameters
are given in Table 3. The phases detected from the XRD patterns are
marked in Fig. 2. While the FCC and BCC1 phases are seen in the
CoCrFeNiAl,.5 alloy, the relative intensity of the BCC1 phase peak is
stronger. This indicates that the weight fraction of the FCC phase is
smaller than that of the BCC1 phase [8]. The BCC1 phase was also
detected in the CoCrFeNiAlp 5Ti alloy with a higher lattice parameter.
Differently, BCC2 phase peaks were seen in the alloy with tetragonal
sigma phase. In the CoCrFeNiAlosTi alloy, the tetragonal structure
sigma phase is not seen. Peaks of BCC1 and BCC2 phases were observed

in alloy. And the lattice parameters of these phases are higher than
those determined in the CoCrFeNiAl) 5Tig.5 alloy. The increase in the
weight ratio of Al and Ti in alloys with high atomic radius caused the
increase of the lattice parameters. Absence of Al with high atomic ra-
dius in the CoCrFeNiTio.5 alloy leads that the peaks of the FCC phase are
similar to the CoCrFeNiAlo. alloy. Diffraction peaks were also de-
termined in sigma phase and BCC1 in the alloy. In the CoCrFeNiAITig 5
alloy, BCC1 and BCC2 phases were detected as in the compositionally
similar CoCrFeNiAl, 5Ti alloy. According to XRD analysis, when the
total atomic ratio of atoms such as Al and Ti having a high atomic
radius exceeds 0.5, it can be seen that these elements stabilize the BCC
instead of the FCC phase in the structure. This result has already been
determined in some studies [11,13,32].

3.2. SEM-EDS analyses of as-sintered CoCrFeNiAlxTiy alloys

Fig. 3, shows the SEM images of as-sintered CoCrFeNiAI,Ti, alloys.
By SEM analyses, a characteristic microporous microstructure of sin-
tered materials is observed. The black spots on the structure can be
attributed to the aluminum oxide and the small amount of porosity
surrounding it. Despite the total 5min process time, pure metallic
powders transformed to simple solid solutions and intermetallic phases
at the end of the process. The chemical compositions of the phases were
measured by EDS microanalysis in the SEM. SEM-map analyses were
also conducted as it can be seen in Fig. 4. When the elemental dis-
tribution is examined in general, Al-Ni-Ti elements are enriched in dark
phases while Fe-Cr elements are enriched in light color phases
(Table 4). The large negative mixing enthalpy values between Ti, Ni
and Al facilitate the formation of Al-Ni-Ti rich phase and the Fe-Cr rich
phase subsequently precipitate around the Al-Ni-Ti rich phase due to
high concentrations of Fe and Cr [9]. Co is distributed throughout the
microstructure in homogeneous manner. This is attributed to the
mixing enthalpies of the constituent binary alloys. For CoCrFeNiAI,Tiy
alloys, the mixing enthalpies between Al and Co, Cr, Fe, Ni and Ti are
—19, —10, —11, —22 and —30 kj/mol respectively; whereas the
mixing enthalpies between Ti and Co, Cr, Fe, Ni and Al are — 28, —7,
—17, —35 and —30 kj/mol respectively [33]. Thus Al attracts Ti-Ni
and Ti attracts Al-Ni to dark regions. Also light regions are enriched
with Fe and Cr. In CoCrFeNiAlos alloy (Fig. 3a) light areas are corre-
sponds to BCC1 phase and dark areas are corresponds to FCC phase, in

CoCrFeNiAlo sTio.s alloy (Fig. 3b) light areas are corresponds to BCC1
phase and dark areas are corresponds to BCC2 phase according to the
XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2. In the CoCrFeNiAl0.5Ti0.5 alloy, the
sigma phase is dispersed in very fine in the dark phase. It can be in-
ferred that the two BCC phases of the CoCrFeNiAlo sTi alloy are Al--
Ni-Ti rich BCC2 phase (dark phase in Fig. 3c) and Fe-Cr rich BCC1
phase (light phase in Fig. 3c). According to the XRD patterns shown in
Fig. 2 and the EDS results presented in Table 4, in the CoCrFeNiTiy 5
alloy (Fig. 3d) dark and light phases are supposed to be BCC1 phase and
FCC phase, respectively. In CoCrFeNiAITio.; alloy the corresponding
SEM-EDS analyses clearly reveals that the Fe—-Cr rich areas are the BCC1
phase and the AI-Ni-Ti enriched regions are the BCC2 phase (Fig. 3e).

The high entropy alloys exhibit high hardness that varies widely
according to the contents of the elements that compose them. However,
the phases formed in the microstructure also have a significant effect on
the hardness. Average hardness values of respectively 401 H V, 618 HV,
7OOHV, 430HV and 441HV were obtained after sintering in
CoCrFeNiAly 5, CoCrFeNiAlg 5Tip.5, CoCrFeNiAlg 5Ti, CoCrFeNiTig. 5 and
CoCrFeNiAITig.; alloys. Fig. 5 gives the hardness graph of the alloys.
The high deviation seen in the error bar in the graph is attributed to the
different hardness of the phases in the alloy. The hardness of the alloys
is given as averages after measurement with the Vickers microhardness
tester at different phases. Intermetallic phases showed high hardness
values when solid solution phases had lower values. Since Al and Ti
atoms have a higher atomic radius than other component elements,
they cause distortion in both FCC and BCC lattice structures and in-
crease alloy hardness. However, hardness is also significantly influ-
enced by the hard based phases formed in the structure besides the
distortion of the solid solutions contained in the alloy. The hardness in
the CoCrFeNiAlo.s alloy is obtained by the solid solution hardening
mechanism, while the presence of AI-Ni-Ti and sigma intermetallic
phases in the CoCrFeNiAl) 5Tig., and CoCrFeNiAlg ;Ti alloys provides a
significant increase in their hardness. Intermetallic compounds are
usually brittle and thus increases hardness but decreases ductility
[3,9,34]. The hardness of the CoCrFeNiAl0.5Ti0.5 alloy is higher than
CoCrFeNiAl0.5Ti alloy by a small margin, although it contained more
intermetallic phase. Hardness in alloys is not only affected by inter-
metallic phases. Al and Ti elements have not only a larger radius than
most other elements, but also stronger binding forces with other ele-
ments, therefore, the increased Al and Ti elements in alloys causes the
larger lattice strain effect and strong binding force so enhancement of
hardness.

In the case of CoCrFeNiTio,.s alloy, the hardness is dominated by the
hard sigma phase, which occurs in small quantities with distortion

occurring in solid solition phases. Relatively low hardness value than
expected is measured in the CoCrFeNiAITig.; alloy, that may e result
from the presence of the Fe-Cr rich solid solution in the structure and
the low ratio of intermetallic Al-Ni-Ti rich phase.

3.3. XRD analyses as-homogenized CoCrFeNiAl,Ti, alloys

XRD patterns of the as-homogenized alloys are shown in Fig. 6, and
the identified phases with their lattice parameters are given in Table 5.
After the homogenization process, in addition to the phases found after
the sintering in the CoCrFeNiAlo.5 alloy, it has been found that tetra-
gonal structured sigma phase is also formed in the alloy. BCC1 phase
observed after sintering was not detected while maintaining the pre-
sence of BBC2 and tetragonal crystal lattice structures in the CoCrFe-
NiAlo 5Tig.5 alloy. In the XRD analysis after homogenization for CoCr-
FeNiAlo.5Ti alloy, it was determined that the tetragonal sigma phase
dissociated from as-sintered alloy. In the CoCrFeNiTio.s alloy, BCC1 is
not seen in the structure but other phases are present. At the end of the
homogenization process, similar phases were determined after sintering
in general, and it was determined that the sigma phase dissociated or
retained its presence in all alloys except CoCrFeNiAITi 5 alloy. Further
work on the formation of sigma phase in high entropy alloys is needed.
No change in the post-sinter phase of the CoCrFeNiAITio.; alloy was
observed except for the lattice parameters. The structure became more
stable due to diffusion in the homogenization process. Therefore, it is
seen that, after sintering, the lattice parameters determined at the end
of homogenization generally increase.

3.4. SEM-EDS analyses of As- homogenized CoCrFeNiAlxTiy alloys

Fig. 7, presents the back scattered SEM micrographs and Table 6
outlines the chemical compositions of five considered homogenized
alloys (analyzed by EDS). SEM-map analyses also were conducted as
shown in Fig. 8. As a result of the homogenization, the chemical
composition of the phases became more stable and the elemental
scattering decreased. Similar to the CoCrFeNiAlo.5, CoCrFeNiAlo sTio.s
alloys, two main phases were observed in the microstructure; dark gray
and light gray. In addition, these phases are dispersed in fine grains
within each other. In CoCrFeNiAlo.s alloy, light areas correspond to
BCC1 phase and dark areas correspond to FCC phase, in

69

Vacuum 155 (2018) 64-72

CoCrFeNiAlo,5Tio.s alloy light areas correspond to sigma phase and dark
areas correspond to BCC2 phase according to the XRD pattern shown in
Fig. 6. Due to the mixing enthalpy, the dispersion becomes more pro-
nounced as a result of the homogenization process. In general, the Fe-Cr
rich phase is precipitated due to its high concentration around this
phase, while the large negative mixing enthalpy between AI-Ni-Ti ele-
ments facilitates the formation of Al-Ni-Ti rich phase during processing
due to enthalpy values. Although Co is dispersed in mean values in most
cases, it is slightly higher in the dark gray phase in the alloys having
higher Al + Ti ratio, while is moderately higher in the light gray phase
in the alloys having lower Al + Ti ratio. In CoCrFeNiAl,,sTi alloy, three
different phases are observed in microstructure as dark gray, gray and
light gray, which correspond to BCC2, sigma and BCC1 phases respec-
tively mentioned in the XRD analysis (see Fig. 6). The dark gray phase
shows a composition similar to other alloys, while the gray and light
gray phases are rich in Fe and Cr elements. Main difference between the
gray and light gray phases is that the richest element Fe is in gray phase
and Cr is in ligth gray phase. In the CoCrFeNiTig,, alloy, when the
matrix consists of dark gray phase (FCC), a light gray phase (sigma)
dispersed in this matrix is seen in this matrix (Fig. 7). CoCrFeNiAITig 5
exhibiting dark and light areas similar to those in CoCrFeNiAlp 5s,
CoCrFeNiAlo.sTio.s alloys which are confirmed to be the BCC2 and
BCC1 phases, respectively according to the XRD pattern shown in
Fig. 6.

Average hardness values of 496 HV, 956 HV, 916 HV, 673H V and
753HV were obtained after annealing in CoCrFeNiAl)s,
CoCrFeNiAly 5Tio 5, CoCrFeNiAlp 5Ti, CoCrFeNiTig5 and
CoCrFeNiAITio.5 alloys, respectively (Fig. 9). The hardness values of all
alloys increased with the homogenization process after the sintering
process. This is related to two important factors. Particularly, formation
of the hard-structured sigma phase has been found to contribute sig-
nificantly to the hardness of alloys after homogenization. Stepanov
et al. [8] studied the CoCrFeMnNiVx alloy and found that hardness of
the alloys was greatly affected by the sigma phase. In many studies it
has been previously determined that the sigma phase enhances the
hardness of the alloys [35-37]. However, it has been determined that
homogenization increases the lattice parameters of alloys. Due to this
increase, the raising distortion in the lattice also contributed to the
hardness. Furthermore, the presence of the Al-Ni-Ti rich intermetallic
phase also enhances the hardness. Especially, the high hardness ob-
tained in CoCrFeNiAlg 5Tip.5, CoCrFeNiAlp 5Ti alloys is attributed to the
presence of higher sigma and intermetallic phase ratio in the structure.

4. Conclusion

Microstructure and hardness properties of CoCrFeNiAl,Ti, high
entropy alloys manufactured by the electric current activated sintered
were studied in the as-sintered and homogenized at 1200 °C for 18h
conditions.

The following results can be derived from the present study:

e Thanks to the ECAS technique used in the study, HEAs production
was conducted without using a protective atmosphere and was
completed in as short time as 5 min.

e Achieved results are in agreement with the literature. In addition.
This paper demonstrates superiority of HEA production in terms of
short time processing compared to previous studies.

e Solid solution, intermetallic and sigma phases similar to those in the
literature have been determined in this study. In addition, it has
been found that the presence of Al and Ti elements having a high
atomic radius in the composition has a positive effect on the hard-
ness values depending on the phases formed.

e High hardness values are highly influenced by homogenization
process and increased to 956H V in the CoCrFeNiAl0.5Ti0.5 alloy
due to the increase in distortion and high hardness sigma phase due
to the increase of the lattice parameters.

e As a result, it has been determined that with ECAS, very high en-
tropy alloys can be produced together with many advantages in a
very short time. It is aimed to continue the detailed studies on the
identification of the phases and the examination of the mechanical
and microstructural properties of the homogenization process.
