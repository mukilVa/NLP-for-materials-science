IMPACT STATEMENT

The chemical complexity induced local structural disorder in the high entropy alloy is distinguished
from the thermal contribution by the combination of neutron and X-ray techniques.

The discovery of multi-element concentrated solid solu-
tion alloys or high-entropy alloys stimulate the ideals of
design new metal alloys and even ceramics with complex
chemical compositions [1-5]. As a new class of mate-
rials, the compositionally complex alloys have attracted
intense research interests over the past decade, leading
to the discovery of some HEAs with excellent prop-
erties, such as high strength [6,7], good wear, corro-
sion and irradiation resistance [8-10]. Though HEAs do
not always have high configurational entropy, the high
entropy effect is still the signature concept of HEAs,
and many of the advanced mechanical properties orig-
inate from the ‘cocktail’ effect [3]. Due to the lack of
chemical periodicity and different atomic sizes, struc-
tural distortion is one of the ‘core effects’ in HEAs, which
affects the mechanical and physical properties including
enhanced hardness [4,11], reduced electrical and thermal

conductivity [12]. However, severe lattice distortion may
also destabilize the single solid solution phase. Recent
TEM experiments have revealed that both NiCoFeM-
nCr and NiCoFeCr precipitate after long-time anneal-
ing at intermediate temperatures [13-15]. The study
of lattice distortion is very important in understand-
ing the advanced mechanical and physical properties of
HEAs. Previous investigations suggest that the degree of
structural distortion of HEAs varies depending on the
different lattice symmetries and chemical compositions
[16-19]. An obvious lattice distortion was observed in
the bcc solid solution alloy [16], however, the chemical
complexity-induced static displacement of atoms in fcc
HEAs may not be as large as hypothesized [20].

Asa typical example, the five-element HEA NiCoFeM-
nCr has been extensively studied, and it exhibits damage
tolerance with tensile strength above 1 GPa and fracture

toughness values exceeding 200 MPaem™!/?, and both
strength and ductile improve at cryogenic temperatures
[21]. The mechanical strengthening in HEAs is believed
to be attributed to dislocation activities [6,22]. By analyz-
ing the width of Bragg diffraction peaks from the neutron
total scattering profiles [20], NiCoFeMnCr solid solution
alloy dose not yield significant difference in lattice dis-
tortion from that of binary NiCr solid solution alloys
with Cr concentration of 20%, 25% and 33%, respec-
tively. Our quantitative analysis [23] of hard X-ray atomic
pair distribution function (PDF) has found that the lat-
tice distortion in NiCoFeMnCr is less than 0.24%. This
slight lattice distortion is attributed to the chemical com-
plexity which may play a critical role to the mechanical
properties. Total scattering methods at ambient temper-
ature can only give an average estimation of the lattice
distortion but cannot distinguish the contribution from
thermal vibration and static lattice distortion, and the
information of individual atomic pairs is also missing.

Local disorders in HEAs result from static lattice dis-
tortion and short-range chemical ordering. Short-range-
order is not rare in traditional alloys and it greatly affects
the physical properties [24], and it is also found in HEAs
[25,26]. Recent experimental study [27] has revealed
complicated magnetic behaviors for NiCoFeMnCr solid
solution alloy, which transfers from paramagnetic to a
spin glass state at 93K and then to a ferromagnetic
state at 38K while maintaining its fcc structure down
to 3K. The transition is likely associated with a ferro-
magnetic ordering of moments carried by Fe, Co, and/or
Mn atoms. In this study, through the combination of
different experimental techniques, including room tem-
perature hard X-ray total scattering, low temperature
time-of-flight neutron diffraction (ND) and extended
X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), the intrinsic
lattice distortion from the chemical complexity and the
local bonding environment of individual elements in
NiCoFeMnCr solid solution alloy are investigated.

Solid solution alloy ingot was prepared by arc-melting
of high purity element mixtures for more than five times,
and finally casted into a copper mold. The polycrys-
talline alloy sample was made by cold-rolling of the ingot,
which was annealed at high temperature (1200°C) for
one day. The cold-rolled specimens were then annealed
at 800°C for 1h. X-ray diffraction measurement con-
firmed that NiCoFeMnCr sample is a single solid solution
phase with a fcc structure. Scanning electron microscope
observation revealed that the grain size of the polycrys-
talline sample is less than 10 um. The sample was cut
into stripes with thickness around 150 um, mechani-
cally polished and the damaged surface layer was then
removed by electrochemical corrosion. The texture and
total X-ray scattering measurement was conducted with a

61.332 keV hard X-ray source at CHESS. The instrument
parameters were calibrated with a standard CeO powder
from NIST. In order to reduce the effect of texture on
the intensity of Bragg peaks, the alloy stripe was rotated
during the measurement with w from —60° to 60° and
the final XRD profile was converted from the stacking
Debye images with Fit 2d software [28]. The ND mea-
surement was conducted at POWGEN station, Spallation
Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory with
time-of-flight neutron source from room temperature to
50 K. The quantitative structural analysis of the X-ray and
ND profiles was performed by using Rietveld refinement
method with the Fullprof software [29]. EXAFS spec-
trum was collected at beam 13-ID-E, Advanced Photon
Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The EXAFS at
the K-edge of each element was measured in fluorescence
mode. The beam size is 100 x 100 um? and nearly per-
pendicular to the sample surface. X-ray fluorescence was
collected in grazing exit mode with angle of 2-3 degrees.
The analysis of Fourier Transforms (FTs) of EXAFS and
fitting were conducted using Demeter software [30].
X-ray diffraction measurement has indicated that the
cold-rolled NiCoFeMnCr single phase solid solution
alloy is slightly textured along <200> direction. With
w scan from —60° to 60°, no obvious texture is observed
and the XRD profile is well refined with a random solid
solution structure model. Figure 1(a) shows the Rietveld
refinement results and the lattice constant is 3.5993(1) A.
There is no obvious mismatch for the position of Bragg
peaks, which suggests that the lattice distortion from the
fcc structure is not visible from the XRD measurement.
NiCoFeMnCr has a simple fcc structure like Ni, careful
analysis of the diffraction patterns can obtain more struc-
tural information. Not taking into account the lattice
strain, Rietveld refinement yields the isotropic thermal
factor Biso = 0.37(3) A. Since a severe lattice distortion
in a solid solution alloy generates large diffuse scattering,
the peak changes due to atomic displacements can also be
measured with the total scattering measurements. Anal-
ysis of atomic pair distribution function (PDF) found
~ 0.24% lattice distortion [23], which is smaller than the
expected value due to atomic size mismatch. If neglect-
ing the difference of the individual atoms, the refined
isotropic Debye factor Uiso = 0.005 A?, which is very
close to the XRD result (0.0047 A? from Bisq = 872 Uigo).
The Debye factor includes the contribution of thermal
vibration and static lattice distortion that cannot be dis-
tinguished from a room temperature XRD measurement.
Neutrons interact directly with the nuclei of atoms,
and ND is more sensitive to the vibration of atoms in
solids. NiCoFeMnCr solid solution alloy was measured
with time-of-flight ND from room temperature to 50 K.

(1) A at room temperature to 3.5851 (1) A at 50K.
Previous low temperature XRD measurements [27] have
revealed that the lattice parameter of foc NiCoFeMnCr
alloy reaches the lowest value at 50 K and has no obvious
change at lower temperatures though it has a magnetic
phase transition at 39 K. At room temperature, the refine-
ment of ND profile yields a thermal factor Biso = 0.393
(9) A? (or Uiso = 0.005A7). The very good agreement of
the Debye factors obtained from XRD, X-ray PDF and
ND suggested that the Rietveld analysis for our sam-
ple is reliable. The temperature dependence of the lat-
tice parameter and Debye factor from ND measurements
are illustrated in Figure 2. The Debye factor changes
to 0.151 (6) A? (Uiso = 0.020 A?) at 50K. By linear
extrapolating the thermal factor to 0K, Bisy = 0.09 A?
and Ui, = 0.001 A? are obtained. The thermal vibra-
tion is close to zero to most materials as shown in
Figure 2(b) for Ni [31]. Assuming the thermal vibra-
tion for NiCoFeMnCr at 0 K is zero, the Debye factor of
0.001 A? at OK is the intrinsic vibration which can only
be contributed by the size mismatch of different elements,

and the corresponding atomic displacement is ~ 0.035 A.
The lattice parameter and Debye factors of NiCoFeMnCr
measured with XRD, PDF and ND are listed in Table 1.
In fact, the lattice constant of NiCoFeMnCr has nearly no
changes below 50 K, and the Debye factor at 50 K is the
upper limit of the intrinsic lattice distortion, which cor-
responds to an atomic displacement value of ~ 0.41 A.
From XRD and ND measurements, the average atomic
displacement in NiCoFeMnCr HEA at zero K due to size
mismatch is thus between 0.035 and 0.041 A.

In order to identify the local structure of individual
atoms in HEAs, EXAFS measurements were conducted
at the k-edge of each element for NiCoFeMnCr HEA.
The FT of EXAFS was derived with Athena program and
the fitting of FIs was performed using Artemis software.
By keeping the same k-range (3-11A~!), the k?-weighted
FTs of NiCoFeMnCr solid solution alloy at the K-edge
of each element is shown in Figure 3(a). The similar
characters of the FTs suggest a very close bonding envi-
ronment of different atoms in the solid solution alloy.
However, the first peak of each element is not exactly in
the same r space, especially to Mn atom, which shifts to

a little larger r-value. In order to fit the FTs and obtain
the local bonding information, a randomly distributed
cluster model (fcc) with 55 atoms in a diameter of less
than 5.2 A is built. Single and multi-scattering paths from
atoms in the first 4 shells around the core atom are taken
into account. There will be too many parameters to fit
because of 5 different elements in the alloy. Since all the
five elements in the solid solution alloy have similar size,
similar bonding environment and similar X-ray scatter-
ing cross section, it is difficult to distinguish them with
X-ray. In order to make the refinement possible, we use
a simple model, which smears the difference of each ele-
ment in the same shell. The core atom is assumed to have
the same bond distances with neighboring atoms of dif-
ferent species in the same shells and the corresponding
D-W factors are also assumed to be the same. Besides
the magnitude, Ep and bond length correction parame-
ters, four D-W factors are refined for the atomic pairs
between the core atoms and the atoms in the first 4
nearest neighbors. The k-range is 3-11A7! for all the FTs

and peaks in the region of 1.5-5 A radial distance are fit-
ted. Figure 3(b) shows the fitting results of Ni K-edge FTs,
where the fitting is pretty good in radial distance of less
than 5 A. The nearest neighbor atomic pair distances and
the corresponding Debye-Waller factors from the fitting
are listed in Table 2. The nearest atomic pair distance is
2.53 (1) A for Ni, Co, Fe and Cr as the core atom. Mn
atoms have a little larger distance with its nearest neigh-
bors (2.54 (1) A), which is consistent with the FTs shown
in Figure 3(a). The average Debye-Waller factor for all
the pairs is around 0.007 A*. From ND measurements,
the isotropic thermal factors of NiCoFeMnCr at 300K
is Biso = 0.393 (9) A’, and the corresponding D-W fac-
tor is 0? = 0.005 A”. The D-W factor obtained from
EXAFS analysis is slightly larger than that obtained
from the diffraction measurements. This is reasonable
because EXAFS only counts the scattering contribu-
tion from limited neighbor atoms (first 4 shells in our
analysis), while diffraction measures the scattering from
long distance periodic atoms. A short-range chemical
disorder may exist in HEAs. Since NiCoFeMnCr con-
tains five elements with similar X-ray scattering abili-
ties, it is difficult to characterize the short-range order
in this solid solution alloy with X-ray and neutron
techniques.

In summary, the structure and Debye factors of
NiCoFeMnCr solid solution alloy is quantitatively char-
acterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray total scattering,
time-of-flight ND and EXAFS methods. Chemical com-
plexity induced lattice distortion is identified by the
intrinsic vibration at 0 K by extrapolating of the Debye
factors from the low temperature ND measurements,
and the static atomic displacement is 0.035-0.041 A. The
EXAFS analysis reveals that Mn atoms in the HEA have
a little larger (~ 0.4%) bond distance with neighboring
atoms than those of other elements. The intrinsic lattice
distortion in NiCoFeMnCr HEA may play a critical role
for the advanced mechanical properties.
