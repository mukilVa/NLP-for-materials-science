An equiatomic AlCoCrFeNiMn hexanary high entropy alloy (HEA) was successfully synthesized by me-
chanical alloying. The 40 h milled powder exhibits chemical homogeneity with an average particle size of
less than 3 um. This alloy, after 40 h of milling produces a solid solution BCC phase (a = 2.89 + 0.03 A), the
lattice parameter of which is very close to the lattice parameter of Fe and Cr. Similar BCC solid solution
phase is also obtained by following a two different milling schedule containing 3 elements i.e., AlCoCr &
FeMnNi separately. Dynamic DSC thermogram of the hexanary alloy powder shows two exothermic
peaks. The peak temperatures and heat evolution corresponding to each peak are sensitive to heating
rates, indicating that the transformations are diffusional in nature. Phase evolution at these heat events
was confirmed through high-temperature XRD and TEM study. It has been found that this alloy is stable
upto 500 °C (773 K). Heat treatment at higher temperatures leads to the formation of a FCC phase closely
related to Ni3Al type and Mn3Co7 type intermetallic phase. Microwave sintered samples show the similar
kind of behaviour as in heat-treated powder. The BCC phase along with ordered Ni3Al type (L12) phase
was observed in the bulk consolidated high entropy alloy. Thermo-physical properties of this alloy have
been studied in order to elucidate its classification as high entropy alloy and to understand the essential
differences with multicomponent glass forming alloys.

1. Introduction

The genesis of the new class of multi-component alloys in
equiatomic or near equiatomic proportions of its constituents has
opened up a new paradigm of materials engineering. There is a
sudden upsurge of research in the scientific community to design
and develop these alloys with the enhanced properties over the
conventional materials [1—4]. It has been argued that pertaining to
the multiple principal elemental composition, the high mixing
entropy of these new alloys can overcome the enthalpies of the
compound formation and leads to the formation of the simple
disordered solid solution crystal structure of FCC, BCC or HCP [5].
The most generalized situation is that the free energy of the alloys
will have a significant entropic contribution. The assumption of
forming simple solid solution phase does not always hold good
because there are only a few alloys which form single-phase solid

solutions [6]. Equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn was the first alloy reported
by Cantor et al. [2], which exhibited a single phase face-centered
cubic (FCC) solid solution phase, although there are five elements
and their crystal structures are different. Inspection of literature
suggests that CoCrCuFeNi with a face-centered cubic (FCC) struc-
ture and AlCoCrFeNi with the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure
are the most studied alloy systems. Wang et al. [7] have reported
that in the AlCoCrFeNi alloy a body-centered cubic phase forms
when prepared by vacuum arc melting technique. This alloy shows
very interesting mechanical properties. Mohanty et al. [8] have
reported the evolution of BCC and FCC phases after 60h of me-
chanical milling of AlCoCrFeNi alloy and reported the phase sepa-
ration after spark plasma sintering. Several hexanary additions of
AlCoCrFeNi have been reported in the literature [9]. However,
AlCoCrFeNiMn is worth mentioning as the phase formation and its
stability are yet to be understood.

Various experimental techniques such as arc melting, injection
casting, electrochemical deposition, mechanical alloying, melt
spinning, laser cladding etc. have been used to prepare high en-
tropy alloys (HEAs). Arc melting is one of the widely accepted
88 V. Shivam et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 757 (2018) 87—97

techniques to fabricate these alloys. However, segregation, as well
as inhomogeneous microstructures, are the main drawbacks of this
popular technique [10—12]. Mechanical alloying is one of the most
promising techniques to produce a homogeneous microstructure
with extended solid solubility among the elements [13,14]. Me-
chanical alloying followed by hot pressing and spark plasma sin-
tering has been used most widely to synthesize bulk HEAs [15,16].
As densification is achieved by passing electric current for a short
duration and soaking time is also limited, chances of segregation
and microstructural changes are also restricted in this process [17].
HEAs synthesized by this technique have been reported to possess a
combination of excellent properties, i.e. high strength and hard-
ness. Apart from spark plasma sintering, microwave sintering is
also an upcoming and viable technique for consolidation of high
entropy alloy powders in the bulk form. In this sintering technique,
the coupling of the microwaves with the dielectric proportion of
the materials leads to the heat generation. Powder compacts
directly absorb the microwave, and it is kept in SiC absorber, which
acts as an auxiliary heat source. The volumetric heating ability of
the microwave leads to the less processing time, and it is also en-
ergy saving [18—20].

High entropy alloys appear to have a few similarities & dis-
similarities with the bulk metallic glass forming alloys. Number of
components being the aspect of similitude; the composition se-
lection criteria, nature of the enthalpies of mixing, atomic size
mismatch etc. are the dissimilar factors. Akin to the glass forming
alloys, understanding the thermodynamic criteria for high entropy
alloy formation remains to be a major challenge. Even though there
has been a considerable effort, a unified picture is still illusive. In
addition to that, the phase and microstructural evolution and its
stability over temperature-time space are the important aspects to
be understood as this would eventually play an important role for
application of these alloys [21]. In this light, in the present work,
AlCoCrFeNiMn hexanary alloy has been synthesized by mechanical
alloying followed by microwave sintering. The phase, microstruc-
ture and its stability have been studied by X-ray diffraction, elec-
tron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, an
attempt has been made to advance our understanding of synthesis
and stability of this alloy system.

2. Materials and experimental details

High purity (>99 wt%) elemental powders of Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ni,
and Mn with particle size < 325 mesh were used as the starting
materials. These powders were mixed in the equiatomic proportion
at room temperature and then milled in a high-energy planetary
ball mill (Retsch PM 400) using tungsten carbide (WC) vials and
balls of 10 mm diameter with the rotation speed of 200 rpm. Mill-
ing was carried out in the wet atmosphere upto 40 h using toluene
as the process control agent with a ball to powder weight ratio of
10:1. Milled powders were extracted at a regular interval of 5h and
were characterized to understand the milling behaviour.

Structural and microstructural characterizations were carried
out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), (Rigaku Mini flex-600 (40 kV-
15 mA)) and high-temperature XRD by Rigaku Smart Lab (45kV-
200mA) with Cu-Ka radiation (A=0.154nm), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), (FEI Quanta 200F) operating at 20 kV, trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM TECHNAI G? T20) operated at
200 kV and optical microscopy (Metalux-3). Thermal analysis of
40h milled powder was performed by using NETZSCH DSC 404 F
apparatus in a nitrogen atmosphere at four constant heating rates
of 10, 20, 40 & 50 K/min. For heat treatment of the powder, samples
were vacuum sealed in the quartz tube to avoid oxidation. Subse-
quently, milled powders of 40h, were consolidated in the form of
green pellets of 10 mm diameter with 637 MPa normal pressure by

using 30 ton capacity press. These green pellets were then sintered
in the microwave furnace (with frequency of 2.45 GHz and power
3 kW) at three different temperatures of 900 °C (1173 K), 950 °C
(1223 K) and 1000°C (1273K) respectively for 1h followed by
furnace cooling.

3. Results

Fig. 1 shows the multiple display of X-ray diffraction patterns of
AlCoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy powders after different milling
hours. The diffraction peaks corresponding to all alloying elements
can be predominantly observed in the initial blending of the
powders i. e. after 10 min of milling. After 5 h of milling, diffraction
intensities for all the elements decreases and the peaks tend to
broaden. The intensity of the peaks corresponding to (111) plane of
Al (d~2.32 A), (311) plane of Al and (220) plane of Mn (d~1.21 A) are
reduced significantly after 5h of milling. It has been found that
diffraction peaks corresponding to Al disappear earlier than the
other elements. Further increase in milling time upto 10 h suggests
that most of the peaks, lose their identity except Mn. This indicates
that the formation of a solid solution by dissolution of most of the
element in the lattice of Fe or Cr. The identification of the host
lattice is not quite straightforward at this stage but it is close to Fe &
Cr. By increasing the milling time for next 5h, it can be observed
that there is no change in the peaks position. However, the peaks
can clearly be indexed to a BCC lattice. Milling upto 20h and af-
terwards indicates the formation of the same cubic phase, the lat-
tice parameter of which is higher than Fe but lower than Cr. The
lattice parameter, as measured from the XRD pattern, turns out to
be (a= 2.89 + 0.02 A). This indication becomes increasingly evident
on further increasing in milling time up to 30 h. The XRD pattern of
the 30h milled powder has a strong agreement with a solid

solution phase with BCC structure. While analyzing the diffraction
patterns with milling time, it has been found that the intensity
decreases and broadening of the peaks takes place. This was ex-
pected because the increase of milling time decreases the crystal-
lize size and increases the lattice strain, which are reported in
Table 1. This increase in lattice strain is mainly due to the intro-
duction of elements in the host lattice of the high entropy alloy and
mechanical working of the powder during the mechanical alloying
process. Although the complete solid solution was found to have
formed at 30 h of milling time, still milling was continued upto 40 h
in order to investigate any further phase transformation. However,
no phase transformation could be detected. Hence it is clear that
40h milled powder shows the formation of a single-phase solid
solution of BCC structure with lattice parameter (a = 2.89 + 0.03 A).
This solid solution formation may be the result of the high entropy
effect of the alloying elements because all the alloying elements are
in the equiatomic proportions. Here it is worthy to note that in
AlCoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy system two elements (Fe, Cr) are
having simple BCC structure and two (Al, Ni) having FCC along with
one (Co) hexagonal structure(HCP). It may be mentioned that Mn is
having a complex BCC structure similar to y-brass structure. It is
important to emphasize that the final high entropy alloy phase is a
simple BCC in structure of Fe, Cr type. It may appear that the phase
selection of high entropy alloy could be driven by the structure of
maximum number of constituent elements of high melting tem-
perature. However, it may not be often always true. Wang et al. [22]
have reported that Al stabilizes the FCC structure when it is less
than 11 at%, and it enhances the formation of BCC structure when it
is present in more amount. From the lattice parameter of the BCC
phase, it can be assumed that the lattice of Fe is acting as the host
lattice for this alloy system and the lattice parameter is slightly
more than that Fe and less than that of Cr. This result is also along
the line of Hume-Rothery rule of solid solution formation, which
restricts the atomic radii difference between two constituent ele-
ments below 15%. In AlCoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy atomic size
difference of elements is not more than 8% what is desired for solid
solution formation.

In order to understand the mechanism of solid solution phase
formation, this hexanary alloy system was divided into two
(ternary) alloy systems. These alloy systems were taken on the basis
of their milling behaviour during the hexanary alloy. AlCoCr and
FeMnNi systems were separately milled upto 20 h and their milling
behaviour with time was followed by XRD. After that 20h, milled
powder from both the ternary alloys were mixed together and they
were milled for another 20h to observe the final phase formation.
The evolution of phases in AICoCr alloy system upto 20 h of milling
as followed by XRD is given in Fig. 2a. From this figure, all the
elemental peaks of Al, Co & Cr are observed after 10 min of milling.
However, with further milling initially Co peaks disappear, and the
peaks get broadened due to the refinement of particle size and the
introduction of strain. With further milling, some of the major
peaks of Al also disappear finally leading to the formation of a BCC
phase after 20h of milling. Milling behaviour of FeMnNi ternary
alloy as followed by XRD is given in Fig. 2 (b). In this system also
individual elemental peaks of Fe, Ni and Mn are observed in the
XRD pattern after 10 min of milling. In this alloy system, Mn peaks

are the first to disappear or lose their identity. This necessarily
means that Mn dissolves into another lattice first. Subsequently,
some of the major peaks of Ni disappear and finally after 20h of
milling a phase evolves, the structure of which could not be

ascertained. The phase evolution of mixed milled powder from the
above two sets over next 20h as followed by XRD is shown in
Fig. 2c. As observed from the XRD patterns, 5h of milling of the
mixed powder leads to the formation of the BCC phase. Further
milling does not lead to any change in the phase structure. How-
ever, the broadening of the peaks is evident. So from this study, it
can be concluded that although mechanical alloying is a non-
equilibrium process, similar phase evolves after different milling
sequence. It appears that phase evolution in this particular alloy
system becomes path independent in the long run.

Morphology of 40h milled alloy powder is given in Fig. 3. It is
observed that the particles are irregular in shape and their size
varies in the range of 1—10 um. Very often river like flow patterns
are observed on the particle surfaces, which have arisen due to the
shear type of deformation and fracturing of the particles during the
milling process. Size distribution of particles in the alloy is in the
micron range and plot of this has been shown in Fig. 4. In doing the
particle size measurement, absolute measurement technique was
adopted, i.e. the particle size was measured directly from the
micrograph and the largest dimension was taken as the particle
size.

The presence of the phases and their alloying effects were
investigated in detailed manner through the transmission electron
microscopy. Bright field images, and corresponding SAD patterns
have been shown in Fig. 5 (a) and 5 (b) respectively. The formation
of ring patterns in the SAD pattern indicates the alloy particles are
randomly oriented. Indexing of these ring patterns confirms that a
single BCC phase (a= 2.91 + 0.02 A) is present in the 40h milled
AlCoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy powder. Additionally, the d-
spacings corresponding to these rings are matching closely with
those observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns. There are two
intense spots in the SAD pattern corresponding to 2.36 A. It does
not match with any known d-spacing of any of the constituent el-
ements, neither this peak was observed in X-ray diffraction pattern.
A careful investigation reveals that this d-spacing corresponds to
Cr203 (110) and Al,03(110). Fig. 5 (c) shows the high-resolution
image (HRTEM) of the 40h milled high entropy alloy powder. In
the image, lattice fringes corresponding to the alloy is observed in
multiple directions. The random orientation of the particles and
lattice fringes further confirms the origin of regular ring pattern in
the diffraction pattern. In addition to that, the particles are faceted,
might have originated from the fracturing of the particles during
mechanical alloying. Due to the presence of different elements in
the lattice, the lattice planes are expected to be distorted. The lat-
tice fringe corresponding to the oxide is also observed in the high-
resolution image. The regions where lattice fringes are disappear-
ing are the regions where fracturing took place, and it is along a
definite plane due to the huge amount of micro strain present in the

alloy. This large amount of micro strain is due to the mechanical
alloying and addition of elements in the high entropy alloys.
Interplanar spacing from these lattice fringes is 2.36 A which
closely matches with the Cr203(110), and 2.11 A corresponds to the
BCC phase of (110) plane.

The STEM-EDS elemental mapping of the 40h milled powder
sample has been shown in Fig. 6. It has been found from the
elemental mapping that all the elements of the hexanary alloy are
distributed uniformly. There is no signature of heterogeneity. This
confirms that all the constituent elements are incorporated in the
host lattice to give rise to the high entropy alloy. However, a
detailed look at the elemental maps indicates that a minor variation
in intensity is present in the maps. As the alloyed particles are
repeatedly fractured, their shapes are not uniform and considerable
variation in thickness also exists. Pertaining to these two factors,
interaction volume of the electron beam with the particles changes
and X-ray signal generation undergoes changes locally, which
might have led to the variation in intensity.

Thermal stability of the 40 h milled high entropy alloy has been
investigated through dynamic DSC at different heating rates (10, 20,
40 & 50K/min) and corresponding thermograms are shown in
Fig. 7. Eventhough, similar thermal events are seen in all the ther-
mograms, their intensity varies. At the higher heating rate, two
exothermic heat events are observed. However, at a lower heating
rate, and the higher temperature heat event is absent. Additionally,

the intensity of the first heat event (exothermic in nature) de-
creases with the decrease in the heating rate. This is due to the fact
that the transformations corresponding to these heat events are
diffusive in nature and they are not so sensitive to the characteristic
temperature. At lower heating rate as long incubation or residence
time is available, the transformation starts at lower temperature
itself, which leads to the reduction in heat evolution at the char-
acteristic temperature. In a similar line, it could be argued as to why
the higher temperature heat events are missing in the thermo-
grams with lower heating rates. With higher heating rates, due to
the unavailability of enough residence time, the heat events are
much more pronounced. It is important to mention that the heat
events at higher heating rates gradually transfer to the higher
temperature side due to the diffusive nature of the transformation
processes. The second heat event that appears at 40 K/min heating
rate is not so clearly visible at 50 K/min heating rate, probably due
to its shift to a higher temperature. However, the transformation
related to this heat event is real that is confirmed by ex-situ heat
treatment and subsequent structural characterization, which has
been reported in the following sections.

Activation energy calculation for the transformation of this alloy
has been done through Kissinger and Ozawa models [23,24]. Plots
were drawn using these equations:-

B\ o£ i
In (4 = —Rr, + C; (Kissinger equation) (1)
E .
In(@) = -RT C, (Ozawa equation) (2)

From the slope and the intercept of the straight line, it is possible
to calculate the activation energy of transformation for both the
equations. Here f is the heating rate in K/min, Tp is the peak tem-
perature (Kelvin), R is the universal gas constant and E is the acti-
vation energy. All the relevant data and activation energies have
been shown in Table 2. The activation energy of the second heat
event was not possible to be calculated as the peak was not
observed at lower heating rates. The activation energies for the first
heat event by Kissinger method and by Ozawa method turn out to
be 310 and 324 kJ/mol respectively. Given the assumptions of these
models, the values are quite close and corroborating.

In order to understand the phase transformations associated
with the heat events as observed in DSC, high-temperature in-situ
XRD was conducted of this 40h milled powder sample at seven
different temperatures form 350 °C (623 K) to 800°C (1073 K) at
regular interval of 75°C (346K). XRD patterns as obtained at all
these temperatures have been shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Fig. 8 consists
of the X-ray diffraction patterns as obtained upto 500°C (773 K)
and Fig. 9 consists of the patterns as obtained above 500 °C (773 K).
From XRD plot, it can be seen that there was no change in the phase

upto 500°C (773K), it means that this alloy is stable upto this
temperature for the said interval of time. Detailed analysis of the
peak positions of all the XRD patterns has been done. It has been
found that at 575°C (K) nucleation of Mn3Co7 and L12 type (Ni3Al
type) phase along with the retained BCC phase takes place. Further
analysis of the diffraction patterns corroborates these phenomena
in the same line upto 650 °C (923 K). It is interesting to observe that
at 725 °C (998 K) a FCC phase appears along with the other retained
phases. This FCC phase (a = 3.63 + 0.02 A) also has a strong prox-
imity with L1z type (Ni3Al type (a= 3.67 + 0.03 A)) phase. It has
been observed from the thermal stability study and nature of phase
evolution that the transformation through which the alloy changes
its phase constituent and microstructure is diffusive in nature.
Pertaining to this behaviour, it is difficult to assign a singular and
accurate temperature for thermal stability. The thermal stability
temperature quoted above should be taken as a ballpark value. In
the X-ray diffraction pattern after heat treatment at 500°C, small
peaks of the second phase could be observed. The intensity of those
peaks being small it has been considered that the volume fraction
of those phases is relatively small to introduce any significant
change in the microstructure.

To understand thermal stability, the high entropy alloy samples

annealed at 500 °C (773 K) and 800°C (1073 K) were observed in
TEM. Bright field images with corresponding diffraction patterns of
these samples have been shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The bright field
image of the alloy heat-treated at 500 °C (773 K) (Fig. 10) reveals the
fine-grained structure of the alloy in which grains are irregular in
shape, and their size ranges between 5 and 10 nm. In the diffraction
pattern the rings corresponding to the BCC phase is obtained. This
further proves that the alloy is thermally stable upto 500 °C (773 K).
The bright field image of the alloy after heat treatment at 800°C
(1073 K) (Fig. 11) shows two types of polygonal grains, which are
basically different in their size. One type of grains, which are mostly
distributed all over the matrix are in size range of 50-100 nm. The
other type of grains, which is scattered in the matrix, is in size range
of 15—30 nm. In the diffraction patterns, the signature of BCC phase,
as well as FCC phase, could be ascertained.

graphs, it can be seen that as the temperature of sintering increases
coarsening of the grains increases. In the same line porosity (shown

950° C (1223 K) & 1000 °C (1273 K) have been shown in Fig. 13. It is
evident that along with the BCC phase, the nucleation of an ordered

4. Discussion
4.1. HEAs and BMGs

The discovery of high entropy alloys began almost at the same
time as that of bulk metallic glass forming alloys [1]. However,
scientific community took serious interest in exploring and un-
derstanding the nuances of alloy design in this category little more
than a decade later [3]. A peek into the alloy design strategies for
high entropy alloys reveals that there are quite a few similarities in
these two alloy systems [25]. For bulk metallic glass formation the
atomic size difference is prescribed to be more than 15% leading to
structural frustration in the crystal which is just the opposite to
what has been prescribed for high entropy alloys. In case of high
entropy alloys, the atomic size difference less than 15% basically
favours substitutional solid solution formation. While the atomic
size mismatch criteria for bulk metallic glass formation may be
considered as opposite to Hume-Rothery rule for solid solution
formation, the same for high entropy alloys may be seen as pro
Hume-Rothery rule. The atomic size difference among all the ele-
ments of AlCoCrFeMnNi alloy is given in Table 3. It is observed that
none of the differences is above 15%. The second level of difference
that exists is the restriction on composition in case of high entropy
alloys. It is recommended to be within 5—35 at%. No such guideline

glasses with equiatomic or almost equiatomic composition has
been reported in the literature [26]. Additionally, for bulk metallic
glasses, it has been recommended that the binary enthalpies of
mixing should be highly negative that favours intermetallic phase
formation. In stark contrast to that, it has been reported that in high

and formation of high entropy alloys. As intermetallic based high
entropy alloys have also been reported, it is a challenge to establish
semiempirical thermodynamic criteria to predict the stability of
high entropy alloys. In a remarkable advancement in that direction,
Zhang et al. [27] have reported that the ratio between TASmix and
AHmix should be taken into consideration. They have shown that in
the ratio of high entropy alloy forming systems it is always more
than one whereas the same for the bulk metallic glass forming al-
loys is less than 1. The binary heats of mixing of several components
in AlCoCrFeNiMn are given in Table 4. These binary enthalpy of
mixing are calculated on the basis of Miedema macroscopic model
[28]. It is observed from the table that none of the binary heats of
mixing is positive which necessarily indicates that there should not
be any likely tendency for phase separation. Moreover, the heats of
mixing values are negative however small. The only high negative
enthalpy of mixing is observed in AI-Ni, Al-Co and Al-Mn systems,
which are reported in Table 4. In these systems, quite a few inter-
metallic phases are observed. Basu and Ranganathan [29] earlier
reported through a series of phase diagram search that number of

intermetallic phases are somehow empirically related to the heat of
mixing. This alloy system is also not an exception to that. For the
present alloy system Tm, ASmix and AHmix are calculated and re-
ported in Table 5. It has been observed that the ratio as proposed by
Zhang et al. turns out to be 2.5 for this alloy system. This is very
much in the range as proposed in the earlier literature. The dis-
cussion above brings out clearly the difference of this alloy system
with bulk metallic glass forming alloys and its suitability as a high
entropy alloy.

4.2. Mechanical alloying behaviour of AlCoCrFeMnNi HEA

In the present work, the alloy system was mechanically milled,
and the evolution of phases was monitored with a specific time
interval. It has been observed that the Al, Co and Mn peaks disap-
pear sequentially. It has been understood that the elements with
lower melting point lose their identity first [30]. In the present case
Al along with Co & Mn gets dissolved and Fe, Cr retains its identity.
Based on this observation, it can be concluded that the melting
point criteria might be system specific or at least does not hold
good universally. Further authors would like to note that

presence of L12 phase can also be discerned.

dissolution criteria based on melting point is partially based on
empiricism and there are other factors, which might change the
dissolution behaviour. Moreover, disappearance or reduction of
intensity of certain peaks of an element in XRD may be the effect of
various other factors relating to the scattering behaviour of that
particular element. A definitive conclusion needs further work and
close sensitivity of the milling behaviour. This issue is worth pur-
suing for better understanding. As the milling time increases peaks

intensity decreases with increase in broadening. This is expected
because the increase in milling time decreases the crystallite size
and increases the lattice strain. The complete formation of the solid
solution phase has been found after the 30 h of milling. Milling was
further increased upto 40h to investigate any phase trans-
formation, but it does not exhibit any change. The earlier report
shows that similar phases are present even after 60 h of milling [9].
This necessarily means that after 30 h of milling no further change
in the structure of this alloy takes place and this excess hour of
milling is basically redundant so far the phase evolution in this
alloy is concerned. The 40 h milled sample showed the single-phase
solid solution of BCC crystal structure, which was confirmed
through XRD and TEM study. In an earlier study, it has been re-
ported that a FCC phase along with the BCC phase appears after
completion of milling though in minor quantities. In the present
case, rigorous analysis of the diffraction patterns does not confirm
presence of FCC phase which has been reported by Wang et al. [9],
and this difference in observation could be attributed to different
milling condition. High-resolution phase contrast images from the
milled powder reveals the lattice structure of the BCC phase. The
lattice plane corresponding to the BCC phase has also been
resolved. However, occasionally a lattice fringe has been resolved

which does not match with the BCC phase. The fringe spacings
match with the oxide of aluminium. As the milling was carried out
in an inert atmosphere, the possibility of forming oxide phase even
in minor quantities can not be ruled out. However, the powder was
dried in air, which could have resulted in minor oxide phase for-
mation. In any case, this cannot be related to the phase structure of
the alloy. In a similar line, carbide formation has been reported in
wet milling and/or after subsequent heat treatment. In case of
carbide formation, corresponding diffraction peaks are observed in
X-ray and electron diffraction patterns. Moreover, predominant
contrast enhancement in STEM-EDS maps is also observed in
localized regions. In the present study, none of the above-
mentioned features could be observed, which rules out the possi-
bility of extended carbon contamination and carbide formation
[31]. In order to further understand the solid solution phase for-
mation mechanism of this hexanary alloys, the alloy was divided in
two ternary alloy systems. These two ternary alloy systems (AlCoCr
and FeMnNi) were milled for upto 20h in the separate vials. After
the 20h of milling these two systems were mixed together and
mixed powder was milled for further 20 h. This new way of milling
of high entropy alloy system shows the same phase as was found in
the single hexanary alloys system. From this study, it can be
deduced that although the mechanical alloying is the non-
equilibrium process but it evolves the same phase and indepen-
dent of the processing route for this particular alloy system.

4,3. Thermal stability of the phases evolved in the AlCoCrFeMnNi
HEA

In the dynamic differential scanning calorimetric thermogram,
it has been observed that phase composition of the alloy changes in
two separate exothermic heat events when it is heated upto 1100 °C
(1373 K). The alloy is stable upto 500°C(773 K), and subsequently,
the heat events appear at around 540 °C(813 K) and 900 °C (1173 K).
It is important to note that the peak temperatures for these heat
events shift to the right as the heating rate is increased. In addition
to that, the heat evolved at each event is increased as the heating
rate is increased. These observations can be explained in the light of
diffusional transformation. Similar behaviour is observed in the
glasses and other metastable alloys when they undergo diffusional
transformation [32,33]. As the diffusional transformation has a
characteristics incubation time as the heating rate increases the
peak shifts to the higher temperature side. Moreover, at lower
heating rates as more of residence time is available, the diffusional

transformation starts beforehand leading to a decrease in the heat
evolution at the peak temperature. The activation energies calcu-
lated based on two different models corroborate well. Though
published literature does not exist on this particular trans-
formation, activation energies for transformation in glasses and
metastable alloys lie in this range only.

The phases evolved with the heat events have been explored
through in-situ high-temperature XRD and TEM. It is observed that
a FCC phase, which is quite closely related to the Ni3Al phase,
evolves after the first transformation event. After the second
transformation, Mn3Co7 phase could be observed in the alloy. The
evolution of this phase after heat treatment has been reported in
the earlier literature [9]. As a result of the evolution of these phases,
the high entropy alloy matrix should become richer in the
remaining elements. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that
the phases are nanocrystalline. It is likely to happen as the alloy is
multicomponent, the diffusion of the elements leading to the
transformation is likely to be sluggish. Similar, phase evolution has
been observed after sintering also.

5. Conclusions
It can be concluded from the present work that

1. AlCoCrFeNiMn equiatomic alloy leads to the formation of a
single-phase BCC (a=2.89+0.03 A), alloy upon mechanical
alloying. Similar phase evolution is obtained by dividing the
alloy composition into two different segments and milling them
in a different schedule.

2. The semi-empirical thermodynamic analysis reveals that the
ratio of TAS/AH is ~2.5 which is well within the range of high
entropy alloys as reported in the literature.

3. The high entropy alloy is stable upto ~500 °C (773 K), and then it
undergoes two diffusional transformations leading to the pre-
cipitation of a nanocrystalline FCC ordered phase
(a= 3.63 + 0.02 A) closely related to Ni3Al type intermetallic
phase with subsequent precipitation of Mn3Co7 phase.

4. Consolidated and sintered pellet of the same alloy after heat
treatment shows the precipitation of similar phases.
