Abstract—An analysis of simple structures of the solid-solution non-ordered high-entropy alloys (HEAs)
witha bcc crystal lattice has allowed us to determine the effect of various parameters on their physicomechan-
ical properties. It was found that, as the hardness increases, the size mismatch results in a decrease in the
modulus of elasticity; however, the normalized hardness characteristic increases. It has been found that, when
the enthalpy of mixing of the bcc high-entropy alloys shifts to negative values, its effect on the hardness and
modulus of elasticity is nonmonotonic. A formula for calculating the modulus of elasticity of high-entropy
alloys with a bcc structure has been suggested that is based on the alloy composition and role of the most

refractory metallic component.

INTRODUCTION

As follows from the title of high-entropy alloys,
they are among materials characterized by anoma-
lously high values of configuration entropy of mixing,
which are substantially higher than those of traditional
multicomponent alloys. To form HEAs, the number of
chemical elements should be no less than five and
their concentrations should be 5—35 at % [1—3]. The
large number of chemical elements results in the max-
imum increase in the configuration entropy of mixing
of this alloy.

It is known that the values of enthalpy and entropy
always compete in their effect in the formation of
phases. The enthalpy of mixing plays role of the mea-
sure of long-range order. If the value of enthalpy of
mixing is high enough to overcome the effect of
entropy and is negative, backgrounds for the long-
range ordering and formation of intermetallic com-
pounds arise.

Thus, the high entropy increases the degree of dis-
order and decreases the free Gibbs energy. Different
elements in this alloy are randomly distributed in the
crystal lattice, and the tendencies to order and segre-
gate is suppressed. In other words, the high entropy
can favor the formation of non-ordered solid solution
rather than intermetallic compounds or other ordered
phases in the course of alloy solidification, i.e., the
high entropy makes the formation of chemically
ordered compounds less competitive. As a result, a

topologically simple structure of the non-ordered
solid solution can form and dominate in a multicom-
ponent alloy.

Numerous attempts to suggest simple parameters
and criteria for the prognostication of phase composi-
tion of multicomponent alloys are available in the lit-
erature [3—6]. In part, these parameters have some-
thing in common with classical Hume-Rothery rules
for the formation of substitutional solid solutions.

However, no definite information about criteria,
which allow one to forecast the physicomechanical
characteristics of solid-solution high-entropy alloys, is
available in the literature. The aim of the present study
is to search for criteria that allow one to predict the
physicomechanical characteristics of high-entropy
bec solid-solution-based alloys.

EXPERIMENTAL

The alloys were prepared by arc melting in an argon
atmosphere using a nonconsumable tungsten elec-
trode and a water-cooled heart with a hole that has a
hemisphere geometry; the mass of the ingots was
100 g. To homogenize the composition of ingots, they
were remelted six to seven times with subsequent fur-
nace cooling at a rate of 100—200 K/s.

The structure of alloys was studied by X-ray dif-
fraction analysis (using a DRON-UM1 diffractometer
and monochromatized Cuka radiation), scanning

electron microscopy (using a Superprobe-733 electron
microscope with a resolution of up to 7 nm), and
Auger electron spectroscopy (using a JAMP-9500F
spectrometer; the resolution is 8—10 nm (in local
Auger-electron spectroscopy mode) and 2—4 um
(in electron microprobe analysis mode)). The hard-
ness Hj; and contact modulus of elasticity E, were
measured in accordance with International Standard
(ISO 14577-1:2002(E)) using the automated microin-
dentation method and a Mikron-gamma tester
equipped with a Berkovich diamond indenter. The
modulus of elasticity was calculated using Poisson’s
ratio for HEAs, which is equal to 0.33.

The theoretical lattice parameter and average
atomic radius were calculated by a rule of mixture
(Vegard’s law [7]), 1.€., Qcaie = Lea; and Peayo= UCIj,
where c;, a;, and r; are the concentration, lattice
parameter, and atomic radius for ith atoms, respec-
tively. This rule was used to calculate the theoretical
electron concentration (number of valence electrons
per atom); Xpixture = UCX; (x; is the electron concentra-
tion for ith atoms in the alloy). The electron concen-
tration for elements, atomic radii, and lattice parame-
ters were taken from [8]. Some elements that comprise
bcc HEAs do not have bec crystal lattice. To calculate
the average lattice parameter for these elements, their
bcc lattice parameter was calculated using the expres-
SION Aga = 2.317, where r is the atomic radius of ele-
ment. The a/r ratio for a bcc lattice is ~2.31.

The size mismatch (Aa/a) was calculated by the
expression

(Aa/a)ay = Xc(a; ~~ exp) /Aexp)» (1)

where q; is the lattice parameter of ith atom and a,,, is
the lattice parameter determined experimentally. The

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The characteristics of studied high-entropy alloys
based on bcc solid solutions are shown in the Table 1,
where Hj; is the hardness, E,.is the modulus of elastic-

ity, E is the calculated modulus of elasticity, C., is the
number of electrons in the outer shell, a is the lattice
parameter determined experimentally, d,.,. is the lat-
tice parameter of the most refractory element, @ is the
calculated lattice parameter, (Aa/a) is the size mis-
match, and AH is the enthalpy of mixing.

In a number of works, the high characteristics of
HEAs were related to the lattice distortion [11—13],
and expressions for calculating the additional harden-
ing of material at the expense of the size mismatch are
suggested. As can be seen from the data given in Fig. 1,
no common regularity of the effect of mismatch on the
hardness of HEAs with a bcc structure is observed. A
number of alloys can be indicated, which, as the size
mismatch parameter increases, demonstrate a trend
toward the increase in the hardness.

solution-based high-entropy alloys.

At the same time, a number of HEAs with the bcc
crystal lattice demonstrate a decrease in hardness as
the lattice distortion increases (see Fig. 1). However,
as the size mismatch in HEAs with the bcc crystal lat-
tice increases, the normalized hardness (/j7/E,)
demonstrates the trend toward the increase (Fig. 2).

We may assume that the effect of size mismatch on
the properties of HEAs demonstrates two tendencies,
i.e., (1) the size mismatch in HEAs increases the non-
conservative elastic movement of dislocation concen-
trated areas, which results in the increase in the hard-
ness, and (2) the size mismatch in HEAs leads to
weakening bonds between neighboring atoms at the
expense of increase in the lattice parameter, which
results in the decrease in the modulus of elasticity.

At the same time, their ratio H,;/E, demonstrates
the trend toward the increase. This is confirmed by
data given in Fig. 2.

For many solid-solution HEAs, the normalized
hardness reaches 0.04 and more. According to data of
[14, 15], the grain size of solid solutions characterized
by a normalized hardness of more than 0.04 is 100 nm
and less. Pure metals, such as titanium and iron in the
nanostructured state demonstrate a high yield strength
(800—1100 MPa), but low plasticity. Solid-solution
HEAs with a bcc crystal lattice are characterized by a
yield strength of 1100 MPa; in this case, they can be
deformed at room temperature [16, 17]. The combina-
tion of these strength and plasticity characteristics of
HEAs is related to their cluster structure [18, 19].

The enthalpy of mixing demonstrates a slightly dif-
ferent effect on the hardness and modulus of elasticity
of high-entropy alloys with a bcc crystal lattice
(Fig. 3). It can be seen from the data given in Fig. 3
that, as the enthalpy of mixing shifts to negative values
to —10 kJ/mol, the hardness and modulus of elasticity
increase. The further decrease in the enthalpy of mix-

ing is accompanied by the decrease in hardness and
modulus of elasticity of HEAs based on bcc solid
solutions.

The modulus of elasticity demonstrates a similar
nonmonotonic dependence on the average electron
concentration (Fig. 4). As the average electron con-
centration increases to 6 electrons per atom, the
increase in the modulus of elasticity is observed; if the
average electron concentration is above this value, the
modulus of elasticity decreases.

The authors of work [11] showed that the lattice
parameter of HEAs is formed based on that of the
most refractory metal, while the modulus of elasticity
of the alloy depends on the fact that its lattice param-
eters is higher or lower than that of the most refractory
metal comprising the alloy. The data given in the table
and in Fig. 5 show that, when the lattice parameter of
the most refractory metal in the HEA is close to that of

the alloy, the modulus of elasticity is close to the cal-
culated one.

For the majority of cases, the lattice parameter of
the most refractory metal of HEA is lower than that of
the alloy; therefore, the modulus of elasticity of HEA
is substantially lower than the calculated modulus of
elasticity.

At the same time, as can be seen from Fig. 6, the
calculated lattice parameter of HEA with the bcc crys-
tal lattice is proportional to the calculated lattice
parameter (Fig. 6, curve /). This allows us to calculate
the modulus of elasticity of HEA with the bcc crystal
lattice using the alloy composition and expression

based HEAs.

Figure 7 shows the experimentally determined
modules of elasticity of bcc solid-solution HEAs,
which are given in comparison with those calculated

by Eq. (3).

An analysis of the reported results indicates that
some parameters of solid-solution HEAs directly are
related to their physicomechanical properties. This
allows us to preliminarily optimize the composition of
HEA to reach given physicomechanical properties. In
particular, the average electron concentration deter-
mines the phase composition of the alloy. A compari-
son of the lattice parameter of the most refractory
metal with the calculated parameters allows us to
determine the expected value of the modulus of elas-
ticity of composition. The values of lattice distortion
and the enthalpy of mixing allow one to judge the level

of the strength characteristics. The specific weight of
assumed composition can also be calculated.

CONCLUSIONS

(1) It has been confirmed that the size mismatch in
HEAs based on bcc solid solutions nonmonotonically
affects their hardness and decreases the modulus of
elasticity. In this case, the normalized hardness
increases.

(2) It was found that, as the enthalpy of mixing
shifts to negative values, its effect on the hardness and
modulus of elasticity is nonmonotonic.

(3) An expression for calculating the modulus of
elasticity of HEA based on a bcc solid solution has
been suggested, which is based on the role of most
refractory metal in the composition.
