The elastic properties and solid-solution strengthening (SSS) of the binary Ni-Co and Ni-—Cr, and
ternary Ni-Co-Cr alloys were investigated by the first-principles method. The results show that
both Co and Cr increase lattice parameters of the binary alloys linearly. However, nonlinearity is
found in compositional dependence of lattice parameters in the ternary Ni—Co—Cr alloys, that is,
Co increases but decreases the lattice parameter at low and high Cr concentrations, respectively.
Co increases the bulk, shear, and Young’s moduli (B, G, and EF), while Cr increases B but
decreases G and E in the binary alloys. In the ternary Ni-Co—Cr alloys, G and E have a similar
compositional dependence to those in the binary alloys, except for B. Based on the Labusch
model, the SSS parameter of Ni—Cr is larger than that of Ni-Co. The SSS effect increases
significantly with Cr addition, especially at low Co concentrations in the ternary Ni—Co-Cr alloys.
Meanwhile, it increases mildly with Co addition at low Cr concentrations but decreases with Co
addition at high Cr concentrations.

|. INTRODUCTION

Ni-based superalloys are widely used in aero-engines
due to their excellent mechanical properties and oxidation
resistance at high temperatures.” The phase of super-
alloys comprises a face-centered cubic (fcc) Ni-rich solid
solution (y phase) strengthened by coherent particles of
L1,-ordered Ni3Al precipitates (y’ phase). In a series of
commercial Ni-based superalloys, such as Inconel
939, CMSX-4, TMW, and so on, Co and Cr are the
main alloying elements, partitioning preferentially in the
y phase.*° Additions of Co and Cr elements certainly
produce solid-solution strengthening (SSS) for the
y phase in superalloys. Furthermore, Co is reported to
increase the lattice misfit between the y and y’ phases and
then enhances the high temperature strength and creep
resistance of superalloys.’ High concentrations of Cr
element allow the formation of a continuous chromia

(Cr,03) scale with inherent sulfidation and oxidation
resistance at high temperatures.°

SSS plays an essential role on mechanical properties of
Ni-based superalloys, and it has been investigated theoret-
ically and experimentally for the past several decades.’~!°
On the mechanism of SSS, it is commonly assumed that
dislocations move through the solvent lattice and are
impeded by the solute atoms, contributing to the
strength of the alloys. The general way to assess SSS
is the linear elasticity theory, in which the two important
strengthening parameters are atomic and elastic misfit
parameters, respectively. The classic Fleischer model
treats the interaction of dislocations with strong pinning
solute atoms on the gliding plane, giving rise to the
square-root-power dependence of strengthening on the
solute concentration, which applies to the dilute solid
solutions.'' The statistical theory proposed by Labusch
models the interaction of gliding dislocations with weak
pinning solute atoms all around the space, resulting in

the multicomponent alloys was further proposed by
Gypen and Deruyttere,’? when the binary SSS caused
by each of the solutes is known. Recently, studies of SSS in
the binary Ni-based alloys, such as Ni-Fe, Ni-Mo, Ni-Co,
and so on, by means of diffusion couples combined with
nanoindentation showed that the two-thirds power depen-
dence of hardness on the solute concentration predicted by
the Labusch model is generally followed.'*”'® However,
few studies of SSS have been reported up to now in the
ternary Ni-based alloys.

Employing the Labusch theory to predict SSS, it is
necessary to obtain information on the atomic and elastic
misfit parameters of the alloys, which can be effectively
calculated by using density functional theory (DFT). In
this work, the compositional dependences of lattice
parameters and elastic properties of the binary Ni—Co,
Ni-Cr and ternary Ni-—Co-Cr alloys have been investi-
gated by using the exact muffin-tin orbitals (EMTO)
method. The coherent potential approximation (CPA) has
been used to describe the random distribution of the
alloying atoms in the alloys. Based on the calculated
results of lattice parameters and elastic properties, the
SSS effect of these alloys was studied by using the
Labusch theory. Particularly, the SSS model proposed by
Gypen and Deruyttere'* for the multicomponent solid
solutions has been discussed for the ternary Ni-—Co—Cr
alloys.

ll. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

First-principles calculations were performed by using
the EMTO method based on DFT.'’'? The
EMTO method is an improved screened Korringa—
Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) method,”° where the one-electron
potential is represented by large overlapping muffin-tin
potential spheres. Generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
(PBE) was used to treat the exchange-correlation density
functional.”! In the self-consistent calculations, the one-
electron equations were solved within the soft core
scheme and_scalar-relativistic approximations. The
Green’s function was calculated for 16 complex energy
points distributed exponentially on a semicircular con-
tour, including states within 1 Ry below the Fermi level.
The basis sets included s, p, d, and f components. The
Ni-3p°4s73d®, Co-3p°4s73d’, and Cr-3p°4s73d* were
treated as valence states. The irreducible parts of the
Brillouin zones were sampled by uniformly distributed
k-points. The k-points of 27 x 27 x 27 were chosen for
the fcc structure.

The disordered binary Ni-(5—30)Co and Ni-(5—25)Cr
alloys and ternary Ni-(10-30)Co-(10—25)Cr alloys
(in at.%) are described with the CPA” as implemented in
the EMTO method. CPA is an efficient and useful approach
to dispose the compositional and magnetic disorder in

random solid-solution alloys. It is noteworthy that
local atomic relaxations are neglected within the CPA
method. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
local lattice distortion has negligible effect on the
equilibrium volume and elastic properties of solid
solutions.”* In the systems where the elements are
similar in size, i.e., Fe—Cr,”* Fe—Ni-Cr alloys,” and
the multicomponent high entropy alloys,”° the single-
site CPA method has been successfully used to study
the phase stability and elastic properties. In this work,
these ternary Ni-—Co-—Cr alloys are considered to be
ferromagnetic for their total energies of ferromagnetic
(Em) states, which are smaller than those of
paramagnetic (Ep) states. The magnetic critical
temperature (Curie temperature, T7-) can be estimated
from the total energy difference, according to the
equation 3kgTc = 2 (Epm — Epm)/(1 — c),”’ where
kp is the Boltzmann constant and c is the concentration
of the nonmagnetic component. Since there is no
nonmagnetic component in the alloys, (1 — c) is set
to 1. The paramagnetic state is described by the
disordered local moments approach.*® The estimated
critical temperature ranges from 85 to 228 K for the
ternary Ni—Co—Cr alloys. Therefore, the calculated
results of the ternary ferromagnetic Ni—Co-Cr alloys
are strictly valid at low temperature.

The fcc structure has three independent elastic con-
stants C,;, Cy2, and C44. These elastic constants were
calculated by volume-conserving distortions. The ortho-
rhombic distortion was used to determine the tetragonal
shear modulus C’ = (Cy, — Cj2)/2:

lil. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Lattice parameters and magnetic moments
1. Binary Ni-Co and Ni-Cr alloys

The ground state properties of the fcc Ni metal were
first calculated, and the results are presented in Table I, in
which other theoretical results and experimental data are
also given for references. It can be seen from Table I that
the lattice parameter of fcc Ni calculated by the EMTO
method agrees well with the other theoretical results
achieved by the projector augmented wave method
(PAW)*? and all-electron full-potential linear augmented
plane wave method (FLAPW),° ! and experimental results
in the literature.*?

The calculated lattice parameters as a function of the
Co and Cr concentrations in the binary Ni-(5—30)Co and
Ni-(5—25)Cr alloys are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b),
respectively. The theoretical results are in good agree-
ment with experimental data, with the typical level of
error (~2%) for DFT lattice constants.**°* The different
errors for the calculated lattice parameters of the Ni—Co
and Ni-Cr alloys result from the exchange-correlation
density functionals, for there is no universal gradient-
level approximation, yielding a consistent error for

transition metals and alloys. Recently, based on an
element-specific optimization of the parameters in the
exchange-correlation functionals, a concept of quasi-
nonuniform gradient-level approximation was introduced
for DFT calculations, and the theoretical lattice parame-
ters and bulk moduli are in better agreement with the
experimental results.*°°° Both Co and Cr increase the
lattice parameter linearly. The slope of the lattice param-
eters Aa/Ax of the Ni—Co alloys is smaller than that of the
Ni-Cr alloys by a factor of 3.7.

The total and local magnetic moments as a function of
the Co and Cr concentrations in the Ni-Co and Ni—Cr
alloys are presented in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively.
The magnetic moments of Co and Ni [u(Co) and p(Ni)]
show a very weak dependence on the Co concentration,
which is in line with the experimental results.*’ The total
magnetic moment increases linearly with increasing the
Co concentration. In the Ni—Cr alloys, Ni and Cr atoms
are antiferromagnetically coupled and the magnetic
moments [p(Ni) and p(Cr)] decrease with the Cr concen-
tration due to magnetic frustration.** Both magnetic
moments vanish at 12.5Cr at.%. A similar compositional
dependence of the magnetic moment was observed in the
binary Fe-Cr alloys.*”

2. Ternary Ni-Co—Cr alloys

For the ternary Ni-(10-30)Co—(10-25)Cr alloys, all
properties were actually calculated with a compositional
interval of 2%. The calculated results were then used for
plotting the contour figures. The calculated lattice param-
eters as a function of the Co and Cr concentrations in the
ternary Ni-(10-—30)Co-(10-25)Cr alloys are shown in
Fig. 3. It can be seen that at various concentrations of Co,
the lattice parameter always increases approximately
linearly with Cr addition, with a larger slope of Aa/Ax
at lower Co concentration. However, Cr addition leads to
a nonlinear dependence of the lattice parameter, that is, to
say at low Cr concentration (~16 at.%), the lattice
parameter almost monotonously increases with Co addi-
tion, while at high Cr concentration (~22 at.%), it
decreases with Co addition. The maximum lattice param-
eter appears at the Ni-10Co—25Cr concentration. The
equilibrium lattice parameters for Ni, Co, and Cr pure
metals with the fcc structure are 3.52 A, 3.53 A, and
3.63 A (equivalent to 2.96 A in bec Cr), respectively.
Obviously, the calculated lattice parameters for the
ternary alloys do not follow the linear rule of mixing
(Vegard’s law). To understand this, it is recalled that the
experimental slopes of the lattice parameters Aa/Ax for

The total and local magnetic moments as a function of
the Co and Cr concentrations in the ternary Ni-(10-—30)

Co addition but decreases markedly with Cr addition.
t(Co) depends weakly on the Co concentration, similar to
that in the Ni—Co alloys, but decreases significantly with
Cr addition. ~(Cr) decreases with Co addition but
increases with Cr addition. As a result, the total magnetic

increases markedly with Co addition while decreases
with Cr addition.

except that the elastic constant C44 is somewhat over-
estimated (The deviation still falls into the typical range
of error for the DFT elastic constants). The polycrystal
elastic moduli of fcc Ni from the present EMTO
calculations also agree reasonably with those in the
literature.°°**

The calculated elastic constants as a function of the Co
and Cr concentrations in the Ni-Co and Ni-Cr alloys are
presented in Figs. 5(a)—5(f), respectively. All the elastic
constants increase mildly with an increase in the Co
and Cr concentrations in the Ni-Co and Ni-Cr
alloys, respectively. The calculated elastic constants of
Ni-10Co, Ni-25Co, and Ni-20Cr alloys are overesti-
mated in comparison with the experimental values of
Ni-10.1Co and Ni-26.35Co alloys by less than 15%**
and of the Ni-19.6Cr alloy by about 20%.*° In general,
there are two sources of error for the DFT elastic
constants. The first part of the error comes from the
neglect of thermal and zero-point vibration in the present
calculations. The second error arises from the exchange-
correlation density functionals**° discussed above. As
shown in Figs. I(a) and 1(b), the EMTO calculations

calculated elastic constants and experimental ones, this
deviation does not affect the trend of compositional
dependence of elastic properties for the Ni-Co and Ni—Cr
alloys. The bulk, shear, and Young’s moduli (B, G, and
E) as a function of the Co and Cr concentrations in the
Ni-—Co and Ni-Cr alloys are presented in Figs. 6(a)—-6(f),
respectively. For the Ni—Co alloys, they all slightly
increase with the Co concentration. For the Ni—Cr alloys,
the bulk modulus increases, and the shear and Young’s
moduli decrease with the Cr concentration. The theoret-
ical compositional dependence of the Young’s modulus
agrees with the experimental results for both Ni-Co and
Ni-Cr alloys.’

with both Cr and Co additions, and the maximum C44

The overall variations of C,;, C12, and C44 as a function of
composition are relatively small. The elastic moduli and
Poisson’s ratio of the ternary Ni-(10—30)Co—(10-25)Cr
alloys as a function of composition are plotted in
Figs. 8(a)-8(e). The bulk modulus increases with Cr

addition but decreases with Co addition. The maximum

On the contrary, the shear modulus decreases with Cr
addition but increases with Co addition. The maximum G
occurs at the Ni-30Co-—10Cr concentration [Fig. 8(b)]. The
Young’s modulus has a similar compositional dependence
as that of the shear modulus [Fig. 8(c)]. The ratio of B and
G is often used to evaluate the ductile/brittle behavior of
the alloys. According to Pugh’s approximation, the mate-

is brittle.“* For the studied compositional range, all B/G

where o is the constant (3 < « < 16) for the interaction
between solute atoms and screw dislocations (« is usually
assumed to be 16 for fcc-structured alloys) and a is the
lattice constant. Using the lattice parameters and shear
moduli shown in Figs. 1 and 6, the average strengthening
parameters were calculated to be 31.35 MPa/at.%~* for
the Ni-Co and 85.73 MPa/at.%~” for the Ni-Cr alloys,
respectively. It can be seen that both Co and Cr additions
result in a distinct SSS for the Ni-Co and Ni-Cr alloys,
respectively, and the SSS effect of Cr is stronger than that
of Co by a factor of 2.7 because the atomic misfit
parameter of the Ni—Cr alloys is larger than that of the

Ni-Co alloys. This indicates that the SSS is governed by the
atomic misfit parameter, and the contribution of the modulus
misfit parameter is small. The average strengthening param-
eter is close to the experimental result of 96.8 MPa/at.%~"
for the Ni-Cr alloys,”!° while for the Ni-Co alloys, the
average strengthening parameter is smaller than the
experimental value of 54.9 MPa/at.%77.!°!° The reason
could be ascribed to the contribution of stacking faults to
SSS in the Ni—Co alloys. It was claimed that Co addition
decreases dramatically the stacking fault energies in the
Ni-Co alloys,’® leading to additional strengthening
through the suppression of cross-slip mediated
deformation.

shown in Fig. 9(a). It is seen from Fig. 9(a) that
SSS increases linearly with both Co and Cr concentra-
tions, and the maximum SSS effect is found at the
Ni—30Co-25Cr concentration.

It is noteworthy that in Eq. (15), the calculated SSS
effect for the ternary Ni-Co-Cr alloys arises only from
the contributions of the binary Ni-Co and Ni—Cr systems,
but not from the Co—Cr system. As a matter of fact,
present calculations have shown that the lattice parame-
ters are related to the interactions among the Ni—Co,

solutions may not apply to the ternary Ni-Co-—Cr con-
centrated alloys. To fully account the SSS effect in the
ternary alloys, the lattice parameters and shear moduli of
the ternary alloys shown in Figs. 3 and 8 are used to
calculate the related parameters in Eqs. (11) and (12) for
the ternary Ni-(10—30)Co—(10-25)Cr alloys, where Co
and Cr are treated as the “effective solute” and Ni as the
solvent as suggested in Ref. 45. The atomic and modulus
misfit parameters in Eqs. (11) and (12) are expressed as

The SSS effect for the ternary Ni-(10-30)Co—(10-25)Cr
alloys is then calculated according to Eqs. (9) and (10).
The compositional dependence of SSS of the ternary
Ni-~(10—30)Co-—(10-25)Cr alloys is shown in Fig. 9(b), in
which a larger SSS effect is observed compared to the
results in Fig. 9(a). Furthermore, a different composi-
tional dependence of SSS is revealed. At fixed Co
concentrations, SSS always increases with Cr addition.
While the effect of Co on SSS depends strongly on the
actual Cr concentration, i.e., at low Cr concentration, SSS
mildly increases with Co addition, which is in accordance
with that from the model proposed by Gypen and
Deruyttere,'* but at high Cr concentration, it slightly
decreases with the increasing Co concentration due to the
Cr—Co chemical interactions.

Co and Cr are the main alloying elements partitioning
preferentially in the y phase of the Ni-based super-
alloys.*> The present work shows that the addition of
Co and Cr produces a significant SSS in the matrix of the
Ni-based superalloys. With the DFT results of composi-
tional dependence of SSS, the alloy composition is able
to be optimized to improve the mechanical properties of
the Ni-based superalloys.

IV. SUMMARY

The elastic properties and SSS of the binary Ni-(5-—30)
Co and Ni-(5—25)Cr and ternary Ni-(10-30)Co—(10—25)Cr
(at.%) solid-solution alloys have been investigated using
the EMTO-CPA method. The calculated results are
summarized as follows:

  

 

(1) Both Co and Cr increase the lattice parameters of
the binary alloys linearly. The slope of the lattice
parameter Aa/Ax of the Ni—Co alloys is smaller than
that of the Ni—Cr alloys by a factor of 3.7. However,
nonlinearity is found in the compositional dependence
of the lattice parameter in the ternary Ni—Co—Cr
alloys, i.e., Co increases and decreases the lattice
parameter at low and high Cr concentrations, respec-
tively, which emphasizes the effect of chemical inter-
actions among alloying elements on the lattice
parameter.

(2) The total magnetic moment increases with in-
creasing the Co concentration for the Ni—Co alloys while
decreases markedly with increasing the Cr concentration
and reaches zero at 12.5Cr at.% for the Ni—Cr alloys. In
the ternary Ni-Co-Cr alloys, the total magnetic moments
increase markedly with Co addition but decrease with Cr
addition.

(3) The bulk, shear, and Young’s moduli of the Ni-Co
alloys increase with Co addition. The bulk modulus
increases, while the shear and Young’s moduli decrease
with Cr addition in the Ni—Cr alloys. The bulk modulus
increases with Cr addition while decreases with Co
addition in the ternary Ni-Co-Cr alloys. On the contrary,
the shear and Young’s moduli decrease with Cr addition
but increase with Co addition.

(4) Both Co and Cr additions result in effective SSS
for the Ni-Co and Ni-Cr alloys, and Cr addition has
a larger effect. In the ternary alloys, SSS increases
significantly with Cr addition and mildly with Co
addition at low Cr concentration but decreases
with Co addition at high Cr concentration in the ternary
Ni—Co-Cr alloys. For the present Ni-Co-—Cr concen-
trated alloys, the model proposed by Gypen and
Deruyttere may not be enough.
