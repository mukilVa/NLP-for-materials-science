The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Mn addition on the microstructure, mechanical
properties, and electrochemical corrosion properties of Alp.3CoCrFeNiMn, (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.3) high-
entropy alloys. All alloys are simple face-centered cubic solid solutions. After addition of Mn to the
Alop.3CoCrFeNi alloy, the lattice parameter and hardness increase from 3.591 A to 3.611 A and from HV141
to HV156, respectively. Meanwhile, the yield stress and ultimate tensile strength increase from 119 MP to

158 MPa and from 295 MPa to 371 MPa, respectively. The increase in yield stress is due to solid solution

1. Introduction

Developments in traditional alloy systems have focused on one
or two principal elements with atomic percentages of more than
50%. High-entropy alloys, a concept proposed by Yeh et al., in 2004,
comprise a new domain in alloy design [1]. These alloys typically
consist of five to thirteen principal metallic elements, the concen-
tration of which range 5—35 at.%. The alloys’ properties can also be
modified by adding minor elements such as interstitial C or B [2—5].
AlCoCrFeNi-based alloys with a combination of Cu, Ti, Mo, or V have
been extensively studied because of the easy formation of the
simple body-centered cubic (BCC) or face-centered cubic (FCC)
matrix. These alloys show several attractive properties such as easy
formation of nanostructure, high strength, good thermal stability,
and high malleability [6—10].

Mn, one of the cheap metallic elements, is abundant in the
earth’s crust and is easy to utilize. It is widely used as an alloying
element [11]. For instance, it can be added to steel to enhance the
abilities to resist impact and wear. It can be used to substitute Ni in
stainless steel in order to reduce cost. It can also increase the
hardening ability of aluminum alloys. In studies on Mn-containing
high-entropy alloys, adding Mn to BCC AlCrFeCoNiCu alloy resulted
in the formation of a Cr-rich phase, dramatically decreasing the
alloy’s compressive strength and ductility | 12]. However, the tensile
strength of FCC CoCrFeMnNi alloy increased along with the
decrease in temperature from 293 to 77 K because of deformation
twinning and a decrease in stacking fault energy [13]. After
annealing at 850 °C, its strength decreased because of grain
coarsening [14]. This alloy also exhibited fracture resistance at both
high and low temperatures [15]. The above studies indicate that the
addition of Mn to an FCC high-entropy alloy may have a positive
impact on its mechanical properties.

So far, very little in the literature discusses the effect of Mn
content variation on the high-entropy-alloy microstructure and

properties. In this work, the effects of Mn additions on the micro-
structures and properties of Alo3CoCrFeNiMnx (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.3)
high-entropy alloys are discussed.

2. Material and methods

The high-entropy alloys Alg.3;CoCrFeNiMn, (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.3,
denoting Mno, Mno;, and Mno3, respectively) were produced
through induction melting and casting in air. Elemental Al, Co, Cr,
Fe, Ni, and Mn with a purity of more than 99 wt% were used as raw
materials. The ingot size was approximately 6 cm x 8 cm x 15 cm.
Samples cut from the ingot were used in microstructure analysis,
hardness measurement, tensile test, and electrochemical corrosion
test. The microstructure was examined by scanning electron mi-
croscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-3400N) equipped with energy-
dispersive spectrometry (EDS, BRUKER-XFLASH6/10). Aqua regia
was employed as an etching solution for the SEM sample after
polishing. The crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffrac-
tometer (XRD, Bruker D8 SSS) using Cu Ka radiation at a scanning
rate of 4° min”! and a 26 range of 20°—100°. The hardness under a
load of 300 g for duration of 15 s was measured by using a Vickers
hardness tester (Future-Tech FR-300e). Five different positions
were measured to calculate the average value and standard devi-
ation. The plate-type subsize specimens (ASTM E8) were prepared
for tensile test (Chun Yen CY-6040A4 universal tensile testers) at a
strain rate of 4 x 10-4 s-! at room temperature. The electro-
chemical corrosion test was performed by potentiodynamic po-
larization measurement using a 3.5% NaCl solution at room
temperature. The test used a Biologic SP-150 potentiostat at a scan
rate of 5 mVs~!,a segment of 1, a scan rang of —1 to 1 V, a frequency
of 10°—10~2 Hz, and an amplitude of 5 mV.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the alloys Mno, Mng, and Mno3.
All alloys exhibit a simple FCC phase. Lattice parameters of alloys
calculated using Bragg formula [16] are 3.591, 3.603 and 3.611 A,
respectively. The lattice parameter of the alloys increases slightly
with an increase in the Mn content because the atomic radius of Mn
(1.27 A) is smaller than those of Al (1.43 A) and Cr (1.28 A) but
slightly larger than those of Co (1.25 A), Fe (1.26 A), and Ni (1.24 A).
Therefore, addition of Mn to Alp. 3CoCrFeNi alloy induces the lattice

expansion. However, this lattice expansion is not large because the
amount of Mn addition is only 0.1 or 0.3 mol.

3.2. Microstructure

SEM images of Mno, Mno; and Mng33 are displayed in Fig. 2, and
their chemical compositions as obtained by EDS analysis are listed
in Table 1. All alloys exhibit a polycrystalline structure with grain
size larger than 500 um. No secondary phase can be observed.
These results confirm the XRD analyses results in Fig. 1, which
shows that all of the alloys comprise a simple FCC solid solution. In
addition, some black dots inside the grains in Fig. 2 identified by
EDS are mainly Al203 inclusion, and the amount of inclusions in the
three alloys is approximate (~2 vol%).

3.3. Hardness

Fig. 3 shows the hardness variation of the Alp 3CoCrFeNiMn,
alloys. The alloy hardness increases from HV141 to HV156 with the
increase in Mn content to 6.8 at%. The strengthening of the alloy can
be attributed to two effects. One is solid-solution strengthening due
to lattice distortion; the increase in lattice parameter of the alloy
after Mn addition (section 3.1) explains this effect. The other effect
is the reduction in stacking fault energy of the alloy, which makes
cross-slipping of dislocations more difficult [17]. This reduction
upon the addition of the Mn may be deduced from the increase in
mean electron hole number of each alloy, which is calculated by the
formula N = S7j,miNvi applied in superalloys [18]. Here, Nis the
average electron hole number of the alloy, n is the number of ele-
ments in the alloy, mi is the atomic percentage of a particular
element, and Nvi is the electron hole number of the element
(Table 2). The calculated mean electron hole numbers of Mno, Mno1
and Mno3 are 2.44, 2.47, and 2.52, respectively. Thus, the mean
electron hole number increases upon addition of Mn.

3.4. Tensile properties

Fig. 4 shows the engineering stress—strain curves obtained from
tensile tests for Mno, Mno1 and Mno3. Table 3 summarizes data for
the yield stress (oy), ultimate tensile strength (oyts), elongation,
and extent of work hardening (Ac = outs — oy). Evidently, oy, ours,
and Ao respectively increase from 119 to 158 MPa, from 295 to
371 MPa, and from 176 to 213 MPa with the increase in Mn content,
while the elongation declines from 59% to 46%. The increase in oy is
due to solid-solution strengthening, and the increase in oyts results
from the increase in work hardening due to the reduction in
stacking fault energy. Engineering stress-strain curves of all of the
alloys (Fig. 4) have a yield point that is related to the homoge-
neously spherical nanoprecipitates with the L12 ordered structure
reported in our previous study [19]. These nanoprecipitates act as
coherent GP zones, and the dislocation cutting through the particle
results in a drop in the yield.

Fig. 5 shows SEM images of the polished surface of Mno, Mno,,
and Mng3 under tension. Clearly, the deformation marks of the
three alloys differ: that of the Mno has a wavy glide, and that of
Mng3 has a planar glide, and that of Mng, contains both types. The
wavy glide created by a material with high stacking fault energy
and narrowly separated partial dislocations facilitates cross-
slipping of dislocations and results in lower work hardening dur-
ing deformation. Conversely, the planar glide is a material with low
stacking fault energy and widely separated partial dislocations,
indicating more difficult for cross-slipping of dislocations and
higher work hardening [20]. The characteristics of the deformation
mark on each alloy’s surface thus confirm the effects of reduction in

3.5. Electrochemical corrosion properties

Polarization curves of the alloys and of SUS304 stainless steel
are showed in Fig. 6, and their electrochemical parameters are
listed in Table 4. The corrosion potentials (Ecorr) of Mno, Mno, Mno3
and SUS304 are —0.169, —0.172, —0.189, and —0.215 V, respectively.
This result indicates that the three high-entropy alloys have
corrosion resistance better than that of SUS304. This result is due to
the higher content of the anticorrosive elements Cr and Ni in the
alloys as compared with that of SUS304. Fig. 6 also shows the po-
larization curves of Mno, Mno; and Mng3 mostly overlap, sug-
gesting that the three alloys are almost identical in terms of
corrosion resistance. The value of Ecor; (Table 4) indicates that the
addition of Mn to the alloy leads to slight deterioration of the
corrosion resistance. This deterioration is due to the increase in Mn
content and the concomitant reduction of the Cr and Ni content.

The pitting potentials (Ep) of Mno, Mno1, Mno,3, and SUS304 are
0.592, 0.579, 0.554, and 0.613 V, respectively. The pitting re-
sistances of the three alloys are thus lower than that of SUS304.
Fig. 7 shows SEM images of the surface after electrochemical
corrosion of Mno, Mno;, Mno3, and SUS304. The appearances of
most pitting pores and inclusions in Mng to Mno3 alloys after
testing are dark-gray square shape and black irregular shape,
respectively. We suggest that these inclusions in alloys will some-
what deteriorate the pitting resistance. However, this effect can be
ignored in evaluation of pitting resistance among the present three
high-entropy alloys due to their approximate inclusion content.
Comparison of the number of pitting holes on each alloy agrees
with the evaluation of pitting resistance from the E, value. The
pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN) of stainless steel is
expressed as PREy = Cr + 1.1Mo + 40.3N — 1.3Mn [21]. This
equation is always used to predict the pitting resistance of the alloy
in a Cl--containing solution. Because Mn reduces the PREy, addi-
tion of Mn to the alloy has an adverse effect on the pitting resis-
tance. Calculated PREN values of Mno, Mnoi, Mno3, and SUS304 are
12.09, 10.20, 6.65, and 18.06, respectively, which are in accordance
with the experimental results.

4. Conclusions

In this study, the effect of Mn addition on the microstructures,
mechanical properties, and electrochemical corrosion properties of
Alp,3CoCrFeNiMn, (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) high-entropy alloys were inves-
tigated. The results show that all of the alloys exhibit an FCC
polycrystalline structure. After the addition of Mn to Alo 3CoCrFeNi
alloy, the lattice parameter, hardness, yield stress, and ultimate

tensile strength respectively increase from 3.591 A to 3.611 A, from
HV141 to HV156, from 119 MPa to 158 MPa, and from 295 MPa to
371 MPa. Solid-solution strengthening due to lattice distortion and
work hardening due to reduction of stacking fault energy are two
mechanisms behind the strengthening. The addition of Mn to the
Alo3CoCrFeNi alloy leads to a slight deterioration of corrosion
resistance.
