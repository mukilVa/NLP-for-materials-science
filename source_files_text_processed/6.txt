High-entropy alloy CoCrFeNiMn was produced by short high energy ball milling (90 min) and spark
plasma sintering (10 min at 1073 K). Co-existence of two fcc-phases with lattice parameters 0.360 nm
and 0.356 nm was demonstrated via HRTEM, XRD and other methods. The matrix fcc-phase with larger
parameter transforms into the more compact phase during annealing up to 1273K. Similar trans-
formation partially occurs after SPS. Some elements, mostly Cr and Mn, released from the matrix phase

and formed precipitates. Up to three types of precipitates, with characteristic size from 10-30 nm to 200
—300 nm, have been detected and studied. Electric and thermal properties of the material, measured at
room and elevated temperature, shown that lattice thermal conductivity plays an important role, along
with free electron thermal conductivity.

1. Introduction

Multicomponent composition CoCrFeMnNi, often referred to as
“Cantor Alloy”, was the first equiatomic material [1] that delineated
the new concept of high-entropy alloys (HEA) [2—4]. This five-
elements composition persists to be in the focus of research
works during last 15 years and became, perhaps, the most thor-
oughly studied system among dozens of HEAs [5,6]. Special interest
in CoCrFeNiMn — based materials is due to their outstanding
combination of properties, such as exceptional damage tolerance
and fracture resistance, especially at cryogenic temperatures [7,8];
high tensile strenght and ductility [9—12]; superplasticity [13];
high hardness and strength [11,14,15]. Basic sub-alloys of this qui-
nary HEA system also possess attractive properties: a medium-

entropy alloy CoCrNi has exceptional damage tolerance at cryo-
genic temperatures [16], and nanocrystalline CoCrFeNi alloy dem-
onstrates exceptional resistance to grain growth [17].

Along the accepted classification the CoCrFeNiMn belongs to a
family of 3d transition metal HEAs with composition CoCrFeNix,
where X = Al, Ti, Cu, V, or Mn [5,6,18—20]. This family is based on
the face-centered cubic (fcc) solid solution CoCrFeNi, which was
commonly considered to be a thermally stable single phase
[21—25]. However, recently the CoCrFeNi phase was reported to be
thermally metastable at 1023 K [26]. After extensive annealing
(800h), tiny precipitates (fringes), a few nanometers long and
about 0.1—0.3nm thick, were found in the HEA matrix. These
fringes, detected by TEM analysis, have the same fcc crystal struc-
ture as the matrix, but with a slightly different lattice parameter:
0.355 nm for the fringe, 0.366 nm for matrix [26]. Existence of two
fcc phases with a lattice constant difference of 0.0001 nm was also
reported for the as-casted CoCrFeNi alloy [27]. The fringes were
hypothetically attributed to, so-called, Guinier—Preston (GP) zones
that precede phase decomposition and formation of stable pre-
cipitates in aging alloys, but the chemical composition of the fringes
was not determined.

Addition of a fifth alloying element with larger atomic radius
1238 A.S. Rogachev et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 805 (2019) 1237—1245

greatly accelerates the decomposition process. For example, when
Al is added, Cr-rich precipitates typically form [26]. Since the radius
of an Mn atom (0.137 nm) is close to that for Al (0.143 nm) and
notably larger than the radii of the other four elements
(0.124—0.125 nm), we may expect similar behavior for the CoCr-
FeNiMn alloy. For a long time, this HEA composition was considered
to be thermally stable: for example, after annealing at 1273 K for 3
days this alloy, according to XRD and SEM data, remained as a
single-phase material [28]. However, during the last few years, the
stability of this phase was disputed in several works [29—32]. First,
some Cr-rich precipitates were observed along grain boundaries in
the arc melted HEA after tensile tests at 1073K (strain rate
2.56+10 © s_!) [29]. In addition, several new nano-scale phases
were found after 5 min annealing at 723 K, of the originally single-
phase HEA, obtained by arc melting, drop casting and severe plastic
deformation. Specifically, a NiMn phase and a Cr-rich phases
formed and their volume fractions increased with increasing
annealing time. In addition, a third FeCo phase precipitated after
1h of such heat treatment [30]. Two types of precipitates were
observed after long-term (1000h) heat treatment of the alloy at
1073 K, without application of any load [31]. The first type was a Cr-
rich fcc phase, with a lattice parameter 1.06 nm, which corresponds
to a Mj3Cg phase and was explained as contamination of melting
equipment and initial powders with carbon. The second precipi-
tated phase contained even more Cr, along with Mn, Fe and Co. This
phase was found to be tetragonal, with lattice parameters of a
=0.88 nm and c ~ 0.45 nm, which is consistent with the o phase
[31]. Annealing for 500 days at 773—1173 K revealed both stable
and unstable behavior at certain conditions [32]. It was shown that
the alloy was a single-phase solid solution after homogenization for
2 days at 1473K and remained in this state after a subsequent
anneal at 1173 K for 500 days. However, a Cr-rich o phase formed at
973 K, whereas three different phases (L10-NiMn, B2-FeCo, and a
Cr-rich bcc phase) precipitated at 773 K [32]. Despite significant
differences in the results obtained, all these works led to conclusion
that CoCrFeNiMn can no longer be considered to be a thermody-
namically stable single phase [31]. Contradictory reports can be
found concerning the influence of precipitates on mechanical
properties. On the one hand, the formation of Mn- and Cr-enriched
precipitates weakens the mechanical strength of the CoCrFeNiMn
HEA at elevated temperatures [29]. On the other hand, it was
shown that nanostructured multiphase microstructure, consisting
of MnNi, Cr-rich, and Fe-Co phases embedded in the HEA matrix,
causes the hardening effect [30]. The precipitation hardening and
strengthening were also reported for the fcc-HEA CoCrFeNi matrix,
due to the formation of a nanosized coherent reinforcing phase L12-
Ni3(Ti,Al) [33].

The most common method for fabrication of CoCrFeNiMn alloy
is an arc melting approach [29,31,32,34], that is often combined
with subsequent hot rolling [9], cold rolling [10,35] or high-
pressure torsion [30] of the ingots. Annealing is usually applied to
as-cast and deformed materials. Alternative methods are: induc-
tion melting, plasma spray and laser cladding [36,37], mechanical
alloying in a high-energy ball mill (HEBM), as well as the recently
developed method of mechanical alloying by means of high-
pressure torsion of a five-element mixture of fine metal powders
[11]. Comparison of the arc-melted as-casted HEA with those, ob-
tained via HEBM and consolidated by spark plasma sintering (SPS),
have shown that the as-cast alloy had a much coarser microstruc-
ture, while mechanical properties were comparable [14]. Thus, the
combination of HEBM + SPS may become one of the most efficient
methods for fabrication of bulk HEA materials. Since SPS involves
heat treatment at elevated temperature, questions concerning
possible decomposition of HEAs and nature of the formed precip-
itate phases are of great importance. Also, it is worth noting that the

structure and properties of the CoCrFeNiMn HEA have been mostly
studied for samples produced by melting.

In our previous work, we reported that single-phase CoCrFe-
NiMn with an fcc structure (according to XRD and SEM) can be
produced during 90 min of HEBM and consolidated by SPS [38].
Here we report the results on the fine structure, local composition,
and the properties of dense bulk material on the base of CoCrFe-
NiMn HEA produced by combination of HEBM + SPS methods.

2. Materials and methods

Metal powders of Co (purity >99.35%, particles size, d < 71 um),
Cr (>98.5%, d<125 um), Fe (>97%, size range 1.5—3.5 1m), Ni
(>99.5%, d~30 um) and Mn (>99.7%, d < 400 um) were mixed in a
mortar, in equimolar ratio. Then the mixture (10 g) was placed in a
steel jar of a water-cooling planetary ball mill AGO-2 (ISSC SB RAS,
Russia) together with steel balls (200 g, diameter 9 mm). Mechan-
ical alloying was performed in air atmosphere, at rotating rate of
the mill 912 rpm (jar rotated at 2220 rpm) for 5—120 min. It was
shown that the single-phase CoCrFeNiMn with fcc structure formed
after 90 min, hence all further investigated samples were prepared
using 90 min of HEBM. It is critical to note that the powders milled
for 15min or longer became pyrophoric, that is fresh as-milled
powders could self-ignite after opening the jar. To avoid this, the
powders were kept in a closed jar during 24h for natural passiv-
ation. The obtained powders were consolidated by means of SPS,
using a Labox 650 (SinterLand, Japan). The powder was placed in a
graphite press-die, heated in vacuum (15—20 Pa) at a rate of 100 K/s
up to 1073 K and sintered at this temperature for 10 min under
uniaxial loading (50 MPa). Disc-shaped samples of 30mm in
diameter and 5—6 mm thick were cut and polished for further tests.

The X-ray diffraction analysis of powders and sintered materials
was performed with a DRON-3M diffractometer (Russia). In addi-
tion to Cu-K, radiation (wavelength }=0.15419 nm), for better
resolution we also used Fe-K, (A=0.19374nm) and Cr-K,
(A = 0.22910 nm) radiation. High-temperature XRD measurements
were made in vacuum 10~?Pa, within the temperature range
298—1273K using an ARL'XTRA diffractometer with high-
temperature accessory HTK2000 “Anton Paar” (Switzerland). A
crystal lattice distortion was determined by means of PDWin 6.0
software that used the method of second moments; instrumental
lines broadening was determined with an LaBg standard (SRM
660b). The SEM and EDS studies were made using a Zeiss Ultra Plus
field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany),
equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer INCA Energy 350
XT (Oxford Instruments, UK). Thin samples for TEM and STEM were
prepared by means of a focused ion beam equipped Nanolab 6000
Helios Dual SEM/FIB (FEI, USA). For high resolution TEM and STEM
we used a TITAN 800-300 TEM (FEI, USA) and a Thermis Z TEM
equipped with DCOR + probe aberration corrector, monochromator
and Super-X EDS technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

Electrical resistivity was measured by a 4-point method with
15 x 2.8 x 0.88 mm plates cut from the sintered samples; thermal
conductivity — by the flash-method using NanoFlash Netzsch LFA
447 (Germany); specific heat capacity was evaluated using a dif-
ferential scanning calorimeter Mettler Toledo DSC-3. The Young
modulus was measured by an ultrasound method; and micro-
hardness with a PMT3 tester (Russia) at loading 50 g. The bending
strength was measured by 3-point method with Instron testing
machine.

3. Results

The XRD patterns for the initial powder mixture, after 60 and
90 min of HEBM and of the sintered alloy are shown in Fig. 1. It can

be seen that the intensities of diffraction peaks of the initial metals
gradually decreased with increasing duration of HEBM. After
60 min, the peaks of Co, Cr, Fe and Mn diminished to essentially
background levels. The noticeable peaks belong to an fcc-phase
with a lattice parameter a = 0.3526 nm, which is close to the lat-
tice parameter of fcc-Ni (0.3524 nm, PDF card 000-04-0850). After
90 min of HEBM we observed sharp shifting of the XRD peaks to-
ward smaller angles, manifesting formation of a phase with
a=0.3604 nm. After SPS, the fcc structure remained, diffraction
peaks intensities increased, and the lattice parameter decreased to
0.3565 nm. Thus, we may conclude that after 60 min of HEBM the
first fcc-phase forms as a solid solution of all metal components in
the fcc-Ni, and after 90 min of mechanical treatment, this phase
transforms into an HEA phase.

The mechanically alloyed powder was heated up to 1273 K with
simultaneous XRD analysis, in order to study the thermal stability
of the HEA phase. Evolution of XRD patterns, presented in Fig. 2,

shows that the fcc structure remains during the heating up and
cooling down. We did not observe any new phase or splitting of the
diffraction peaks. However, the crystal lattice parameter changes
during heat treatment (Fig. 3). Heating was carried out in a step-
like manner with isothermal stages at 873, 1073, and 1273K.
Three sequential XRD patterns were acquired during each
isothermal exposure and lattice parameters (a) and lattice distor-
tion (5) were determined from each pattern. It can be seen that the
lattice parameter, a, increases with increasing temperature, but
slightly decreases during isothermal stages. Increase of a occurs
due to thermal expansion of the lattice, while its decrease may be
explained by ordering and closer packing of atoms in crystal
structure during annealing at constant temperature. The ordering
effect is evident from the narrowing and growth of diffraction
peaks (Fig. 2). Continuous decrease of lattice distortion may also be
related to the relaxation of the crystal structure (Fig. 3). The
structure shrinking effect diminished at 1273 kK, hence we may
assume that the lattice parameter reaches its equilibrium value at
that temperature. The value of a before annealing was equal to
0.3595 nm, after annealing and cooling it decreased to 0.3565 nm.
The thermal expansion coefficient was evaluated as 12-10~° 1/K in
the beginning (heating from 298 to 873 K) and 15-10-© 1/K in the
end of the experiment (cooling from 1273 to 298 K).

Morphology of the powder mixture undergoes significant
changes in the process of HEBM (Fig. 4). Initial powders of very
different sizes and shapes (Fig. 4,a) cold-welded into relatively large
uniform particles with spongy surface after 60 min of treatment
(Fig. 4,b). This powder, in turn, transformed into fragmented
irregular particles after 90 min of HEBM (Fig. 4,c). TEM analysis of
such particles, including the obtained electron diffraction patterns
(EDP), shows that they primarily consist of nano-scale crystals of
the fcc-phase with a = 0.36 nm (see Fig. 5,a and Table 1). Thorough
analysis of HRTEM images reveals the existence of nano-crystallites
with two slightly different d-spacings, 0.206 nm and 0.208 nm, as
well some amorphous regions and distortions of the atomic planes
(Fig. 6). In addition, some rounded precipitates, about 5—15 nm in
diameter, were found with high resolution STEM (insert in Fig. 7,a).
EDS analysis along the scan line is also presented in Fig. 7a. It can be
seen that these precipitates are enriched with Cr (up to ~ 60 at.%)
and depleted of all other components (below 10 at.%). Notable
fluctuations of the EDS-determined local chemical composition can
be observed in the matrix phase (Fig. 7a), i.e. the concentrations of

Co and Cr vary within the range 17 = 26 at.%, Fe within 18 + 28 at.%,
Ni 15 +21 at.%, and Mn 13 +25 at.%. Some part of these deviations
may be related to the inaccuracy of the “standard-less” EDS analysis
with extremely high space resolution; however, it is highly prob-
able that nanometer-scale fluctuations of chemical composition
occur in the HEA matrix.

Consolidation of the mechanically alloyed HEA powder was
made by SPS at 1073K for 10min. The microstructure of the
consolidated material looks completely uniform, without pores or

composition deviations, in SEM (Fig. 8a). Etching of the polished
cross-section in a mixture of strong acids (HCI + HNOs3, - so called
“aqua-regia”) developed boundaries between grains and some
cavities that may be related to precipitates of a second phase
(Fig. 8b). This microstructure shows that etching occurs mostly
along grain boundaries, and size of the grains correlates with the
size of powder particles after 90 min of HEBM (compare Figs. 4c and
8b). Results of EDS analysis presented in Table 2 (average of 9
Measurements) show that the composition of the consolidated
sample is close to equimolar, with some minor excess of Fe and lack
of Ni and Mn.

According to TEM and EDP analysis of the consolidated mate-
rials, the size of microstructure elements increased after SPS, and
additional electron diffraction lines appeared (Fig. 5b and Table 1).
These additional lines can be roughly attributed to an fcc structure
with a= 1.05 nm. Comparison of the Fig. 5a and 5,b shows, that
after SPS some relatively large inclusions of up to 200—300 nm in
size, that were not found in the powder particles after HEBM, forms
in addition to previously existing small (~10 nm) precipitates. The
existence of different types of precipitates in the consolidated
material was confirmed by HAADF-STEM images in combination
with X-ray mapping (Fig. 9) and high-resolution EDS scanning
along the line (Fig. 7,b). Two types of inhomogeneities are preva-
lent. First, relatively large (up to 200 nm) Cr-rich inclusions that
contain a few percent of Mn and practically zero Co, Fe, or Ni.
Second, smaller (10—30 nm) rounded precipitates that contain all
five elements. Line-scan EDS analysis shows that the precipitates
contain slightly more Cr and Mn (25 + 30 at.%) and less Fe, Ni and Co
(13 +16 at.%). The matrix contains 16+27at.% of Fe and Ni,
11 +22 at.% Co, 10+15at.% Cr, and 15+25at.% Mn (approximate
ranges). Therefore, we can conclude that after SPS the composition
of small precipitates becomes more uniform with matrix phase,
however, a small amount of large precipitates appear that contain a
higher concentration of Cr. If the Cr-rich precipitates are undesir-
able phases, the content of this metal should be decreased, which
may help to avoid precipitation. However, variation of the metal
ratio requires additional research, in order to avoid altering
composition of the matrix phase.

HRTEM study of the matrix phase confirms the co-existence of
two fcc phases with close lattice parameters (Fig. 10). Perhaps, one
of them pertains to the small precipitates, and another — to the
matrix itself. Nano-twins were observed in the fcc phase with
a=0.360nm (Fig. 10,b). Atomic packing inside the large pre-
cipitates does not conform to an fcc phase, as evident from Fig. 11
and Fig. 12. The crystal structure of this phase is a topic for
further discussion.

Some experimentally measured properties of the consolidated
material are presented in Fig. 13, as a function of temperature. As
expected, thermal diffusivity and electrical conductivity are several
times less than corresponding values for pure metals, while specific
heat capacity is comparable with initial components. The material
has an average density of 7.5 g/cm?, microhardness 4.03 + 0.48 GPa
and flexural (bending) strength 919 + 20 MPa. The Young modulus
and Poisson ratio (ultrasonic measurements) were found to be
184 GPa and 0.3, correspondingly.

4. Discussion

There are three main topics for discussion concerning bulk
CoCrFeNiMn HEA: formation routes, stability, and properties. The
combination of mechanical alloying and spark plasma synthesis is a
relatively new approach for fabrication of HEAs, the casting-based
methods are used much more often. Up to now, this approach
has been demonstrated in a few works [14,38,39]. The results show
the strong influence of the mechanical alloying regime on phase

formation. Thus, 60 h required for obtaining mixture of fcc + bcc
phases, when the rotating rate of planetary ball mill was 250 rpm
[39]; the pure fcc phase was obtained after 8hat 400 rpm [14];
while only 90min was sufficient to obtain the same result at
912 rpm as shown in this work (see also [38]). In addition, we ob-
tained an fcc-HEA powder without the addition of a process control
agent (N-heptane) that was added to the mixture to avoid cold
welding in the previous works [14,39]. The consolidation temper-
ature used in the SPS method should be about 0.7T;,, where Typ is a
melting temperature of the considered alloy. The experimentally
measured melting temperature of the CoCrFeNiMn phase was re-
ported as 1607 K [40,41], 1523 K [14], or 1543 K [42], while atom-
istic modelling predicted T,=1679K [43]. Therefore, the
temperature range 1070—1175K may be considered to be an
optimal for SPS (it can be noted that Mn lowers Tp of the 4-
component basic alloy CoCrFeNi, which is 1717 K [41] or 1707K
[43]). A material with density of 7.5 g/cm? was obtained in the
present work with SPS temperature 1073 K, which is slightly lower
that the value 7.85 g/cm? achieved in the work [39] under similar
conditions. The theoretical density for an equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn
fcc-phase with lattice parameter 0.36 nm is equal to 8.03 g/cm?.
Therefore, if we presume that the consolidated materials are single-
phase, they must have porosities of 2.24% for [39] and 6.6% in the

results from the work [14], where porosity was 7.61% after SPS at
1073 K and decreased to 0.12%, when SPS was carried out at 1273 K.
However, our SEM study did not reveal residual porosity at polished

cross-sections without etching (Fig. 8,a). Thus, we may conclude
that the observed lower density occurs due to presence of different
phases with lower theoretical densities.

Despite the intense research into the phase stability and
possible phase transformations in the Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mn system, this
issue is still far from being resolved (see also Introduction). For cast
equiatomic alloys, the fcc-solid solution with lattice parameter (a)
0.359 nm is commonly accepted as the major or sole phase. This a
value was first obtained for a major dendritic phase in the pio-
neering work [1] and confirmed in many other works; e.g., precise
neutron diffraction study shown a=0.3597 nm, with error less
than 0.00001nm [42]. Shrinking of crystal lattice from
a= 0.3602 nm to a=0.3595nm was observed earlier for as-cast
and annealed (1273K for 24h) samples, respectively [34]. Me-
chanical alloying produces fcc-phases with a=0.3536+0.02 nm

39], and 0. 3595 + 0.3604 nm (present work, XRD and SAED data, —
Figs. 1, Fig. 3, Fig. 5,a, Table 1). HRTEM (Fig. 4) shows co-existence of
two phases in reigh boring crystallites, with close lattice parame-
ters: d-spacing 0.208nm corresponds to an fcc phase with
a= 0.360 nm, and d-spacing 0.206 nm — to a= 0.356 nm. Since the
corresponding X-ray diffraction peaks are broadened and blurred
due to intense plastic deformation and lattice distortions occurred
during HEBM, it is hard to distinguish these phases, so they look
like one fcc phase in XRD patterns (Fig. 1). However, transformation
of the fcc-phase with larger a into an fcc-phase with smaller a can
be clearly observed during annealing of the HEBM treated powder
(Fig. 3). This transformation is accompanied by lattice relaxation
and precipitate formation. Both phases, with larger and smaller a,

survive under the relatively soft annealing conditions (1073 K
for 10min) taking place during SPS, as shown in Fig. 10. On
the other hand, two-phase (fcc + bcc) powder, obtained by
HEBM, converted during SPS into a single fcc phase with
a= 0.3589—0.3590 nm, as it was reported in the work [39]. From all
these results, we can draw a conclusion, that two fcc phases with
close lattice parameters co-exist in the HEA alloy after HEBM. The
first of which has a = 0.360 + 0.001 nm, while for the second phase
a= 0.356 + 0.001 nm. When annealing, the first phase tends to
“unload” some elements, mostly Cr and Mn, which results in lattice
relaxation and shrinking, and transformation into the second
phase. The elements released from the first phase during this
process form precipitates.

At least two types of precipitates were found in the material
after SPS (Fig. 9). New diffraction lines appearing after SPS (Fig. 5,b
and Table 1) can be interpreted as a fcc-phase with a= 1.05 nm,
which is close to the structure of Cr23C. (a = 1.066 nm). At the same
time, the d-spacing and angles measured with HRTEM (Fig. 11) can
be interpreted as a bcc structure with a=0.73 nm. The electron
diffraction lines calculated on the basis of this interpretation,
exhibit reasonable agreement with experimental data (Table 1).
Finally, a quite complicated structure was observed within the Cr-
rich precipitates (Fig. 12). This structure possibly belongs to a bi-
nary (Cr,Mn)C,-type carbide [44] or some not-recognized inter-
metallic phases in the Cr-Mn system. This question requires
additional study.

The transport properties of the materials, presented in Fig. 13,
show the significant role of lattice heat conductivity. It is known
that for pure metals, when electric and heat conduction occur due
to free electrons, the Wiedemann—Franz law describes the corre-
lation between electrical and thermal conductivities:

A
gL: (1)

where L = 2.45-10-8 W-Ohm/K? is the Lorenz number. Calculating
thermal conductivity as }=cpy and substituting into eq. (1),
we obtained L~ 4.5+0.2-10 8 W-Ohm/K?. Strictly speaking,
within the temperature interval 350—573 K, the dependence of i/o
on T can be described with the empirical equation 4/
o = 12.68—0.0173T + 0.0000683T? (W-Ohm/K). Such dependences
lead us to conclude that transport of electric charges and heat oc-
curs due to different carriers: electric current — by electrons, and
1244 A.S. Rogachev et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 805 (2019) 1237—1245

heat — by electrons plus phonons. Electrical resistivity of the ma-
terial at room temperature is 106.5 nOhm-cm, which is about an
order of magnitude larger than the resistivity of Co, Cr, Fe and Ni,
but 2.6 times smaller than Mn. A coefficient of thermal expansion
(CTE), (34.2 + 0.2)-10~> K', is much less than for pure metals. These
values are typical of multicomponent alloys and disordered solid
solutions, because of intense electron scattering in its crystal lattice.
Increase of electrical resistance and decrease of CTE were also re-
ported for mechanically alloyed and SPS-consolidated Cu-Cr
nanocomposites. In addition to the lattice disordering, this effect
was also explained by the significant increase of specific surface of
grain boundaries due to microstructure refinement [45]. Similar
explanations can be suggested for the relatively low thermal con-
ductivity (14-21 W/m-K at 350—573 K) and thermal diffusivity.
The obtained values of electric and thermal conductivity are in a
good agreement with data obtained earlier for the CoCrFeNi alloy:
specific electric conductivity (9.1—9.4)-10° S for temperature range
300—400K, and thermal conductivity 11—20.5W/m-K for
298—573 K [46].

Mechanical properties of the materials exhibit less plasticity and
more hardness than typical fec-HEAs produced by crystallization of
the melts, and comparable with ceramic-metal composites. Thus,
the maximum flexural strength of TiB2-based cermet with HEA
binder CoCrFeNiTiAl was 800 MPa, and Vickers hardness 23.56 GPa
[47]. Possessing expectable lower hardness (microhardness 4 GPa,
see Section 3), the HEA CoCrFeNiMn, studied in the current work,
exceeds 900 MPa in flexural strength that is higher than the cermet
material.

5. Conclusions

Due to great importance of HEAs for materials development
[48], questions of their production routes, structures, stability,
strengthening precipitates and properties, take on _ special
significance.

High-entropy alloy CoCrFeNiMn was produced after 90 min of
high energy ball milling and consolidated by spark plasma sintering
at 1073 K for 10 min.

The as-milled alloy is composed of two fcc-phases with close
lattice parameters, 0.360 nm and 0.356 nm. Both phases remain in
the SPS-consolidated material, which was demonstrated via
HRTEM and other methods.

The fcc-phase with the parameter 0.360 nm transforms into the
more compact phase (0.356nm) during annealing up to 1273 K.
Similar transformation partially occurs after SPS. Some elements,
mostly Cr and Mn, released from the matrix phase and formed
precipitates.

Two or three types of precipitates, with characteristic size from
10 to 30 nm up to 200—300 nm, have been detected. Some of them
have crystal structure close to Cr23Cg, another possesses a complex
crystal structure built of Cr and Mn atoms, that was not identified
with any known intermetallic phase. Formation of a carbide phase
may be possible because of SPS in a graphite die; thus, use carbon-
free dies could be a way to avoid carbide precipitates. Further
structural research is needed to decode structures of all
precipitates.

Electric and thermal properties of the material are measured at
room and elevated temperature. It is shown that lattice thermal
conductivity plays an important role, along with free electron
thermal conductivity.

Thus, the results obtained allow us to suppose that the recently
formulated contradiction concerning stability of the CoCrFeNiMn
high-entropy phase can be resolved, by accepting the existence of
two fcc phases: metastable (a=0.360nm) and more stable
(a = 0.356 nm).
